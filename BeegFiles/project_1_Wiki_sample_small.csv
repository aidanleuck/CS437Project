Bo Diddley said of the song: ""A lot of the things I did in the Chess studios, we were just goofin' around... They played it back, and it shocked all of us! Of course, they cut out all the dirty parts."" Music critic Maury Dean, while rejecting the idea that the track is ""the first rap song"", says that it is ""the first major soul tune to feature a total spoken patter of pal put-downs to a rockin' beat... Bo's lightning right hand chops chords like sugar cane. The incessant beat throbs into the hot American evening nocturne of streetwise savvy. Rap - with a side of ghetto-blast humor.""

The portal of the balcony is also rich with baroque decorations, with two pilasters, other garnitures on both sides, ending with three masks, the biggest one in the middle; the family emblem dominates the tympanum: it is formed by a heart confixed by an arrow and surmounted by the baronial crown.

The other five balconies on the first floor are made with carved stone; the brackets are fluted and have some decorations; on the second floor there are five stone balconies, two windows and two recent balconies. 

As soon as you enter the lobby, there is an atrium: today, of the two ancient staircases, there is only the one leading to the first floor; in the late 19th century they built another staircase leading up to the second floor.

The palace is situated between the Church of Saint Nicholas of Bari (along corso 6 Aprile) and via Porta Stella, where there are two other entrances on the first floor, leading to its eight rooms with accessories, and to the ten rooms existing on the second floor.

The site was discovered by a group of archaeologists, during an archaeological excavation done in the Sampur area in December 2017. However the ruins, including an old Stupa were completely destroyed and flattened out by a group of vandals on 18 December, few days after the discovery.

During the Sri Lankan civil war, many of the archaeological sites in the North and Eastern provinces of Sri Lanka were not properly investigated or recorded as the prevailed threats from the LTTE rebel group. After the defeat of LTTE in 2009, the archaeology department carried out several projects across the North & Eastern provinces to investigate and identify the places with archaeological evidences and the some of places were finally declared as archaeologically protected reserves and monuments. As the instructions given by Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, a similar project was started after the 2015 to investigate the unknown archaeological sites in the Eastern province of the country. In December 2017, as a part of the project a group of archaeologists unearthed a dilapidated Stupa during an excavation done in a Hindu temple premises in Soodaikudah in Sampur. According to the initial evaluations done by the archaeologists, the Stupa is a construction of early Anuradhapura period (377 BC to 1017 AD) with a girth of 15 feet.

The ruins of the stupa were found on land which is used by a recently built Hindu shrine. The local people in Soodaikudah are said to be displaced in 2006 along with Muttur people and had been resettling around the area from 2013. The Hindu shrine, constructed near to the stupa mound, was officially registered in 2014.

A few days after the identification, the Stupa mound had been cleared completely by a group of people using a bulldozer before the Department declared it as an archaeologically and historically important site. The destruction was first revealed by police who conducted investigations following a tip-off given on the police hotline. The incident was reported to the authorities including the Secretary to the President and the Eastern Province Governor by the chief monk of Seruvila Mangala Raja Maha Vihara. A police investigation was started following the incident and meanwhile a court order was issued by the Muttur magistrate, suspending all rehabilitation works on the Hindu temple.

On 23 December, the speaker Karu Jayasuriya revealed that the people who destroyed the Soodaikudah Stupa in Sampur has been identified. A few days after the statement, three people were arrested with a bulldozer and a lorry which were used to destroy the Stupa. The bulldozer had been brought to the Hindu shrine to dig a drinking well around 100 metres away from the Kovil but they had used the vehicle to destroy the Stupa. Local media reported that the two drivers involved in the destruction of the Stupa had met with accidents at different places on the same day.

After communist takeovers of both Poland and mainland China, there had been no official diplomatic mission between two states. Communist Poland only considered the newly-established People's Republic of China as the sole representative of China, while the Taiwan-relocated Republic of China was hostile to all communist factors.

Since the end of communism in 1989, Poland and Taiwan had started embracing a stronger and advocating tie. Being allies of the United States and have enjoyed a large decree of success with democratic ideals, the two nations seek to tie stronger.

Mungret Abbey is a medieval friary and National Monument located in County Limerick, Ireland.

Mungret Abbey is located immediately west of Dooradoyle and northeast of Mungret College, southwest of Limerick city centre, to the south of the Shannon Estuary.

Mungret was an early monastic site, founded before AD 551 by Saint Nessan (Neasán) the Deacon. At one point there may have been as many as 1,500 monks and six churches operating.

John O'Donovan claimed a fourth-century date, predating Saint Patrick.

In 908, Cormac mac Cuilennáin, King of Munster, gifted the abbey three ounces of gold and a satin chasuble.

It was plundered on four occasions in the 9th century by Vikings. High King Domnall Ua Lochlainn destroyed the monastery in 1107.

Mungret claimed episcopal status 1152, but was deemed to be too close to Limerick. 1179 the then king of Munster, Domnall Mór Ua Briain, granted the monastery to Brictius, Bishop of Limerick.

Mungret then became a parish church (built 1251−72), operated by the Augustinian Canons Regular.

Mungret Abbey church was used by the Church of Ireland until 1822. The antiquary Austin Cooper wrote about Mungret in 1781.

The building was extended and the tower, the priest's living quarters, was added during the 15th century.

A bell was found at Loghmore nearby, called the Bell of Mungret.

Since the Troubles began the South Armagh area, especially around Crossmaglen, was one of the most dangerous places for the British security forces, and the IRA's South Armagh brigade carried out numerous ambushes on the British Army and the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC). This included the 1975 Drummuckavall ambush and the 1978 downing of a British Army Gazelle helicopter.

When the patrol was near St Patrick's Church, a red Royal Mail-type van fitted with armor plating drove past the patrol and came to a sudden stop. IRA members opened fire from the back of the van with an M60 machine gun and AR-15 rifles. The British soldiers returned fire but did not claim any hits. Christmas shoppers scrambled for cover. Three soldiers at the front of the patrol were fatally wounded. They were taken to Musgrave Park Hospital but were declared dead on arrival.

Dr. Shuhei Ono is an associate professor of earth, atmospheric, and planetary sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In his research, he measures isotopes of sulfur and other elements to investigate water-rock-microbe interactions, seafloor hydrothermal systems, the deep biosphere, and global sulfur cycles.

Dr. Shuhei Ono earned his B.S. in geology in 1994 and his M.E. in economic geology in 1996 from Waseda University in Tokyo, Japan. He completed his Ph.D. in geochemistry from Pennsylvania State University in 2001. Ono joined the Geophysical Laboratory of Carnegie Institution of Washington to complete his postdoctoral research, and in 2006 received a geobiology fellowship from the Agouron Institute to support his work. In 2007, Ono became a faculty member at MIT.

Ono earned the 2017 Paul Gast Lectureship award from the European Association of Geochemistry, given to mid-career scientists who have made outstanding contributions to geochemistry.

Ono has developed an instrument that uses tunable infrared laser direct absorption spectroscopy to detect the ratio of different isotopes in a sample of methane, which can indicate the methane’s source. The instrument has enabled his group to discover the origins of methane from seafloor hot springs, and to understand the effects of microbial and atmospheric methane cycling on the isotopic composition of methane in a sample.

Ono’s team also measures sulfur isotopes to study how early microbial life impacted atmospheric and ocean chemistry. Specifically, they are looking at Archean rocks in South Africa and Western Australia that are 4 to 2.5 billion years old. They also are using sulfur isotopes to investigate sulfur cycling within mid-ocean ridge hydrothermal vent systems and sulfate reduction in the deep subsurface.

Additionally, Ono collaborates with Massachusetts Institute of Technology Professor of Atmospheric Science Ronald Prinn to explore the natural and environmental sources of nitrous oxide, a powerful greenhouse gas and catalyst that destroys ozone.",Shuhei Ono,60

"Schooner barge

A schooner barge is a type of ship; a schooner converted as a barge. Schooner barges originated on the Great Lakes in the 1860's and were in use until World War II, although a few survived into the 1950s.

Even though steamboats were used for time-critical routes such as for passengers and mail, schooners were still economical to use for bulk cargoes such as grain, wood, or iron ore. Steam tugs were introduced on the Great Lakes that could tow one or more barges. Since old schooners were available, they could be adapted to towing service with reduced crews. When winds were favorable, the schooner barge could have one or two sails rigged to save fuel in the steam tug. Eventually schooner-rigged wooden ships were purposely built for use as barges. The concept was later extended to salt-water use, with, for example, the United States Navy converting some schooners for use as barges for coal. 

Because of rough weather and small crews, schooner barges were frequently lost from tows, set adrift during bad weather, or sunk. By the 1920's, schooner barges were no longer in practical use on the Great Lakes since steam and diesel powered ships provided better operating flexibility and safety, with lower crew costs than a tug and barges hauling the same amount of cargo.",Schooner barge,71

"The Army of a Dream

The Army of a Dream is a speculative fiction short story written by Rudyard Kipling, published in the Morning Post in June 1904. It models an alternate way of organizing the military, along lines of responsibility and competence instead of heredity and privilege, as he had seen that the British Military was at that time.

Using indirect exposition, Kipling conveys to the reader that the narrator is experiencing the story as a dream. The story itself involves a military man taking the narrator around and showing off his military unit, the ""Tynesiders"". It is revealed that in their society, military service is voluntary, but almost universal, because only those who have served may vote, along with a number of other incentives. Unlike military forces common through much of history, those of the story are not authoritarian or what one might otherwise call ""militaristic"", but are a sort of citizen militia composed of competent men focused on dealing with any threat to their community and nation.

Rudyard Kipling was, in general, a major influence on one of the 20th century's most influential writers, Robert A. Heinlein. In his seminal work Starship Troopers, Heinlein models a similar society, where one is not a citizen unless one becomes a veteran of government service. While this does not have to be in combat forces but is actually more like being a civil servant, that novel follows characters in the mobile infantry, and is in fact the origin of the mech trope that has pervaded science fiction since. Also foreshadowed is Heinlein's fondness for the competent hero, a character who — though usually bearing normal human flaws — is rugged and self-responsible, able to do most things at least on a fundamental level and functioning with a high level of confidence and self-actualization.",The Army of a Dream,78

"Elmer S. Rigdon

Elmer S. Rigdon (June 16, 1868-December 13, 1922) was a member of the California State Senate from Cambria, California. He was the key proponent for building the Carmel-San Simeon Highway along the Big Sur coast. He was a member of the California Senate Committee on Roads and Highways and during World War I promoted the military necessity of defending California's coast. He persuaded the legislature to approve the project. In 1919, the legislature approved submission of a bond measure to voters. 

He was the son of Rufus Rigdon and Indiana Scott Rigdon. His parents homesteaded in Cambria during the 1860s. Elmer Rigdon became a rancher and timber harvester. He also owned a brickyard in Cambria and the Bank Mine on San Simeon Creek. He extracted quicksilver from the mine from 1903 to 1906, when he sold his interest. He was elected to the California state assembly in 1914 and to the state senate in 1916.

Dr. John L. D. Roberts, who founded Seaside, California, had a strong interest in building a road along the California central coast. In 1897, he walked the entire stretch of rocky coast from from Monterey to San Luis Obispo in five days and mapped out the course of the future road. He photographed the land and became the first surveyor of the route. In 1915, he presented the results of his survey and photographic work to a joint session of the California legislature. Roberts initially promoted the coastal highway to allow access to a region of spectacular beauty, but failed to obtain funding. Rigdon embraced the necessity of building the road. As a member of the California Senate Committee on Roads and Highways during World War I, he promoted the military necessity of defending California's coast and persuaded the legislature to support the project. The $1.5 million bond issue was approved by voters, but construction was delayed by World War I. Federal funds were appropriated and in 1921 voters approved additional state funds.

Rigdon died in office before the highway was completed. At the dedication of the highway on On June 27, 1937, his wife dedicated a silver fir to her husband's memory. A small park and drinking fountain in a turnout between Vicente Creek Bridge and Big Creek Bridge, north of Lucia. was dedicated as the Elmer Rigdon Memorial Drinking Fountain.",Elmer S  Rigdon,88

"Pseudo K-tuple nucleotide composition

The Pseudo K-tuple nucleotide composition or PseKNC, was extended from Chou’s Pseudo amino acid composition or PseAAC . Both PseAAC and PseKNC are of vector descriptor, but the former represents protein or peptide sequences while the latter represents DNA or RNA sequences. 

To avoid completely losing the sequence-order information for protein and peptide sequences, the pseudo amino acid composition or PseAAC was proposed by Kuo-Chen Chou. But how about for DNA and RNA sequences? To address this problem, the pseudo K-tuple nucleotide composition or PseKNC was proposed. For the convenience scientific community, a freely available web server, called PseKNC and an open source package, called PseKNC-General were developed in 2013 and 2014, which could convert large-scale sequence datasets to pseudo nucleotide compositions with numerous choices of physicochemical property combinations. PseKNC-General can generate several modes of pseudo nucleotide compositions, including conventional k-tuple nucleotide compositions, Moreau–Broto autocorrelation coefficient, Moran autocorrelation coefficient,Geary autocorrelation coefficient, Type I PseKNC and Type II PseKNC. 

Like PseAAC in computational proteomics and proteome analysis, PseKNC has also been increasingly used in computational genomics and performing various genome analyses.",Pseudo K tuple nucleotide composition,99

"Nairobi College

Nairobi College was a small radical left junior college in East Palo Alto, California for ethnic minority students in the late 1960s.

The College was part of a movement for ethnic minority groups in the United States to have dedicated academic programs to train themselves in the theory and practice of liberation, resistance, and revolution. These programs were referred to as ""Third world colleges"", which sought to practice the principles of self-determination and community empowerment while teaching left-radical ideology in rejection of the perceived bourgeois ideology and white control of mainstream academic institutions. Prominent advocates for this movement included graduate student Angela Davis and professors Herbert Marcuse of the University of California San Diego and Carlos Blanco of Thurgood Marshall College. Other colleges founded as part of this movement included Malcolm X Liberation University, Uhuru Sasa Shule, the Center for Black Education, and Thurgood Marshall College.

Nairobi College began classes in the fall of 1960 with initial funding of $100,000 donated by area residents and private foundations.. 20,000 books were donated by schools, individuals, and publishers, which were kept in two residential garages. Anyone at least 16 years of age was welcome to enroll at no cost. The first class had working-class 100 students, some of whom were high school dropouts. The all-volunteer faculty numbered about 40 and consisted of student and professors from nearby universities as well as community organizers.
Based out of a small private home in East Palo Alto, Nairobi College operated out of stores, church buildings, and homes throughout black, Latino, and Asian neighborhoods in the San Francisco Peninsula.
The college leadership hoped that spreading classes out in these existing structures would integrate it with the needs and reality of their surrounding community, calling it a ""college without walls"" in contrast to the perceived ""ivory tower"" of mainstream academia. It was a two-year college.

The students were primarily African American and Hispanic, although working-class white students were also included. Most of them worked full time and took classes in the evenings. All students were required to utilize their training to provide skilled volunteer work three hours per week in support of area social organizations, such as schools, community health centers, and legal aid.

Instructors included Ed Roberts, a disability rights activist, Tello Nkhereanye, a leftist from South Africa, Frank Omowale Satterwhite, a community organizer, Aaron Manganello, a Marxist minister of education for the Brown Berets, and Mary Hoover, a Stanford academic advocate for African-American English.

"Corral del Coliseo

The Corral del Coliseo is an old corral de comedias (a Spanish theatre) of 16th century in Seville (Andalusia, Spain), near the Plaza de la Encarnación square, which was later converted into a corral of neighbors and is currently is used as a residential building.

It has been documented that in March of 1612, ""Claramonte"" directs the Corral del Coliseo in Seville, and promises to provide the Company with ""eight old or already premiered comedies for four hundred reales, and new or never seen, at a rate of 250 reales"". It is also known that in 1620, ""Ortiz y los Valencianos"" represented the work of ""Claramonte"" ""The Great King of the Deserts"" in the Corral del Coliseo. In this same year the Corral del Coliseo suffered a devastating fire.

A lawsuit in 1619 between the owner of the Corral del Coliseo and some authors of comedies also serves as a guide to understand the society of the time. The complaint was lodged by Francisco de Rivera, landlord of the Corral del Coliseo, on June 5, 1619, before Juan Muñoz de Escovar, """"of the Council and Accountant major of accounts of His Majesty, Judge of the Performance of this city of Seville"""", against Juan Acacio and Diego de Vallejo (both authors of comedies), because they decided to represent the autos sacramentales of Corpus Christi in the ""Corral de doña Elvira"". With this, they contravened a previous resolution, of May 25, of the same judge in which he arranged to be represented in the Corral del Coliseo. For what said the landlord of the Corral """"...because such contempt should not be given, to your mercy I beg and beg, command to arrest the said authors of comedies, which are Juan Acacio and Diego de Vallejo, and remove the posters that are placed, executing them for the penalties in which they have incurred and in the damages that the treasury of this city for the said cause have been followed and continue, and I ask for justice. / So for proof of the above, I make a demonstration of one of the posters that the aforementioned have posted by the corners and the auto for your mercy provided and notifications, and I ask for justice..."""". They serve these writings to revive the society of the time and understand the theater of the Spanish golden age.

The Warakamai, now more frequently known as the Warrgamay, are an indigenous Australian people of the state of Queensland.

Their language, Warrgamay, is now extinct. It was a variety of Dyirbalic, and appears to be composed of three distinct dialects:""Wargamaygan"" spoken around the lower reaches of the Herbert River; ""Biyay"" spoken at the mouth of the Herbert, in the area of Halifax and Bemerside; and ""Hinchinbrook Biyay,"" spoken around the coastal area south of Cardwell and offshore on Hinchinbrook Island.

The Warakamai were the indigenous people of Halifax Bay, and held in Norman Tindale's calculations, approximately of tribal domains. An early resident, James Cassady, specified that they had 50 miles of shortline extending into the hinterland approximately 15 miles. Their northern neighbours were the Girramay, while to their south lay the Wulgurukaba.

The Warakamai were divided into several hordes:

The intermarriage of groups has been classified as follows:

Circumcision as an initiatory rite was unknown among the Warakamai. They did practice tooth avulsion, ritual scarification and piercing of the septum to wear nose bones. Polygamy was common, and widows were married to their deceased husband's brother.

The area of Halifax Bay first began to be settled by white colonialists in 1865. At that time the numbers of Warakami were estimated to amount to roughly 500 people. Within 15 years, they had declined by 300, a mere 40 of the surviving 200 being men. The difference was due to their being relentlessly hunted and gunned down by mounted native troopers under white supervision, together with settlers, both of whom 'shot as many of the males of the tribe as possible.'",Warakamai,135

Peter Henry Jones (1 March 1917 – 30 July 1984), was born in Monmouth and is best known for his role in assisting Sir Clement Price Thomas in the pneumonectomy of King George VI in 1951. 

He subsequently remained professionally close to Price Thomas, pursuing a career in Cardiothoracic surgery.
Jones was educated in Pontypool at Haberdashers' Aske's West Monmouth School.

Qualifying in medicine from Westminster Hospital Medical School in 1939, Jones stayed on at the hospital to complete his junior house posts. Between 1942 and 1946, he joined the Royal Army Medical Corps as a regimental medical officer to a field artillery regiment in North Africa and Italy. He witnessed the Salerno landing and the attack on Monte Cassino. Declining an elevation in rank, he opted to endure the rest of the war along with his regiment. Returning to England in 1946, Jones continued his surgical training and passed the FRCS in 1948. Afterwards, he joined the surgical team under Sir Clement Price Thomas at the Brompton Hospital and Westminster Hospitals.

Baguley and Davyhulme Hospitals appointed Jones as thoracic surgeon in 1955 and Manchester Royal Infirmary took him on in 1960. Also, in 1960, Jones attended the Presbyterian Hospital in San Francisco to learn new techniques in open heart surgery. After spending six months with Dr Frank Gerbode, he returned to Westminster Hospital as thoracic surgeon. 

As Hunterian Professor, he gave a lecture on bronchial sleeve resection in 1958. 

In 1951, Jones spent three weeks as resident surgeon in Buckingham Palace. On 23 September 1951, whilst still in the palace, he had assisted Price Thomas with the pneumonectomy on King George VI’s lung cancer. In return, he was awarded the MVO. The surgery has since been researched and re-enacted by real surgeons in Stephen Daldry's The Crown (TV series).

Jones enjoyed fishing and antique clocks. Coronary artery disease and an illness resulting in loss of voice limited his activities and resulted in his premature retirement.

"Facing It

""Facing It"" is a poem by American poet and author Yusef Komunyakaa. It is a reflection on Komunyakaa's first visit to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Komunyakaa served in Vietnam from 1969 to 1970, during which time he wrote for army newspaper ""Southern Cross"". It is the second poem written by Komunyakaa about Vietnam. R. S. Gwynn has referred to the poem as “the most poignant elegy that has been written about the Vietnam War.” 

The poem was his second to deal with the topic of the Vietnam War. He first wrote a poem dealing with Vietnam fourteen years after returning from the war. ""Facing It"" was written approximately a year after visiting the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Komunyakaa has said ""Facing It"" influenced the other poems of the collection in which it was first published, ""Dien Cai Dau"".

The poem concerns the speaker's visit to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, a black gabbro wall engraved with the names of American soldiers who died in the war. The wall is polished so that it is reflective.

Like jazz, the poem appears to be free of form, but it is in fact split into a verse-bridge-verse structure similar to many jazz songs. The first thirteen lines reflect on the speaker's reaction, and the final thirteen reflect on the reactions of others; these two sections are separated by a shorter section describing the act of finding and touching a name.

The poem is one of several by Vietnam veterans to deal with memorials. Andrew Palmer and Sally Minogue have contrasted the ""ambivalent response"" of ""Facing It"" with W. D. Ehrhart's ""The Invasion of Grenada"", in which the speaker rejects the idea of a Vietnam memorial and refuses to engage with ""...that
vast black wall of broken lives"".

The poem has been anthologized in a number of collections, and is perhaps Komunyakaa's best known work.",Facing It,142

The brass is in front of the monument to Etchingham's ancestors. The Latin inscription under Elizabeth Etchingham identifies her as the first daughter of Thomas and Margaret Etchingham. The text under Agnes Oxenbridge identifies her as the daughter of Robert Oxenbridge. Both Judith M. Bennett in ""The Lesbian Premodern"" than Alan Bray in ""Homosexuality in Renaissance England"" recognized the memorial brass like those made for a married couple and therefore think that the one between Oxenbridge and Etchingham was a particular friendship, probably a medieval example of Lesbian relationship.

Elizabeth Etchingham was the daughter of Thomas Etchingham II (1424/25 - 1486) and Margaret West, daughter of Reginald West, 6th Baron De La Warr. The monument to Thomas Etchingham I and his parents is in front of the memorial brass of his granddaughter.

Agnes Oxenbridge was the daughter of Robert Oxenbridge (died 1487), of Brede, and his wife Ann Livelode (or Anne Lyvelode) (died 1494).

The Etchingham and Oxenbridge families were deeply connected: Thomas Oxenbridge (died 1540) inherited both Etchingham and Mountfield manors from his mother Elizabeth, sister of Elizabeth Etchingham, born in 1460, 8 years after the death of her sister; she married in 1500 Goddard Oxenbridge (died 1531), son of Robert Oxenbridge and Anne Lyvelode, and therefore brother of Agnes Oxenbridge.",Agnes Oxenbridge and Elizabeth Etchingham,145

Nicolucci's first criminal conviction in Canada came in 1973 for drug possession, followed by possessing $2 million of counterfeit money in 1978. Nicolucci became a confidante of Vito Rizzuto, who went on a trip to Venezuela in 1984 where they met the allied Cuntrera-Caruana Mafia clan, regarded as drug specialists. That same year, a probe into Nicolucci's drug trafficking by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) found 12 kilograms of cocaine at Vancouver International Airport in false bottom suitcases intended for pick up by Montreal associate William Papier. The RCMP kept close surveillance on Nicolucci and Papier in Montreal through wiretaps, and even followed them by plane to Caracas, Venezuela where they received help from the United States Embassy in Venezuela, and bugged the mobsters hotel rooms. In 1985, the RCMP amassed enough evidence on Nicolucci and Papier, and the two were convicted and sentenced to 14 years in prison in Montreal Superior Court in relation to the Vancouver haul; they appealed, but the verdict was upheld.

In 1991, serving less than half his sentence, Nicolucci was released on parole. Within months of Nicolucci's release, he was money laundering, moving $31 million through a phony currency exchange in Montreal secretly run by the RCMP in an elaborate sting operation. Officers traced a $1.7-million purchase of 280 kilograms of cocaine made by Nicolucci on behalf of Vito Rizzuto. However, Nicolucci refused to pay the debt to the Colombian Cali cartel, claiming the cocaine was of poor quality. As a result, the Colombians kidnapped Nicolucci from Castel Tina on August 2, 1994, a Montreal strip club he managed, and smuggled him across the border to Miami, Florida, and then into Colombia. With an international warrant for Nicolucci's arrest, the Colombian police found Nicolucci in a house in Cali, Colombia in February 1995. He was extradited back to Canada and brought back to Montreal on May 30, 1996. Nicolucci was found guilty of 437 charges for drug trafficking and money laundering, and sentenced to 19 years in prison.

Colin Robertson (born 1983), known as Millennial Woes or simply Woes, is a Scottish alt-right, neoreactionary political activist, blogger and YouTube personality. He describe himself as a neoreactionary and ""white advocate"", and openly identifies with the alt-right. He has been described as a far-right, white nationalist, white supremacist, ""garden-variety"" racist across media, and frequently publishes content that is critical of multiculturalism. He has been described as a ""household name"" and a ""darling"" of the alt-right, as well as a ""rising star of the movement"".

Woes attended a London art college in Tooting in the mid-2000s, an experience he describes as 'dizzying' due to the ethnic diversity of the school and district. After a period of clinical depression, unemployment and underemployment, he launched his YouTube channel at the end of 2013. ""Vice"" had labeled his platform a ""popular alt-right YouTube channel"" towards the end of 2016, with around 18,000 subscribers and 2.4 million views.

In November 2016, Woes delivered a speech at the National Policy Institute Conference 2017, in Washington DC. According to some media, his involvement was directly linked to then President-elect Donald Trump's disavowing of NPI. A few days after Trump's election, Woes spoke in Seattle, claiming that he did not believe the President-elect was a ""rabid white nationalist"", but that ""restor[ing] America"" may mean getting ""more white people here and fewer brown people"".

In January 2017, he began receiving coverage from BBC News and national newspapers, after Scottish tabloid the ""Daily Record"" claimed to have doxxed Millenial Woes, ""expos[ing]"" his birth name, family's home address and sending reporters to confront him. Woes was reported to have ""left Britain"", posting a video to his Youtube channel named ""Fugitive Woes"". UK-based Civil rights group Civil Liberty defended him, claiming the doxxing was a ""hate campaign fomented by ""[The] Daily Mirror"""", while men's issues blog Return of Kings claimed British ""media outlets"" were ""attempting to incite a mob against him"".

On 6 February 2017, he gave a speech entitled """"Withnail and I as Viewed From the Right"""" at The London Forum in Kensington, which ""The Independent"" described as ""a meeting of prominent far-right voices"". Hope Not Hate covered his appearance at the event, claiming he recited the Fourteen Words as part of his speech. On 25 February 2017, Woes gave a speech in Stockholm organised by , which had been promoted as ""the most important alt-right conference in Europe"". According to IBTimes, the event took place in a ""secret location"" in Södermalm. In August 2017, ""Salon"" claimed that Millennial Woes was one of only a few alt-right platforms to rapidly grow, alongside Red Ice, VDARE and The Rebel Media.

On 10 December 2017, according to Right Wing Watch he began a interview series named ""Millenniyule 2017"", interviewing various internet personalities from the alt-right movement, including an appearance from Faith Goldy.

Woes is a follower of the white genocide conspiracy theory, and it has been reported as ""central to his beliefs"". He has been described in media as an anti-Semite, and identified himself as one. Describing what he called the ""Jewish Question"", he claimed that ""there are problems with the Jewish people""..",Millennial Woes,163

"Kurt Selchow

Kurt Selchow (born 28 May 1886 in Oppeln, Upper Silesia, Germany) was a Minister () and Director of the Z Branch, the Signal Intelligence Agency of the German Foreign Office () before and during World War II. 

His father was Hugo Selchow. His wife was Erna Selchow and he had one daughter called Gitta. He was educated in Oppeln until 1906 when he became a soldier. He was initially assigned to the Infantry, then in 1912 he was transferred to Signal Corps (""Nachrichten Telegrafen Bataillon"") in Frankfurt (Oder). 

He served with the German Army of World War I as a signal officer with the troop. Selchow stated that even in the midst of World War I, he pointed out to the Chief Signal Office that much of the work being done in the German Army Signal Corps belonged properly to the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs because of its diplomatic nature. The Chief Signal Officer did not agree with this statement and during World War I much of the work done by the Army was diplomatic in nature. Directly after the war, Selchow entered the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where he organized the cipher bureau. He brought with him several soldiers who had been with him during World War I. These were Schauffler, Paschke, Zastrow, Brandes, Hoffman and Kunze. He is listed as a Principal Foreign Office Specialist (""Vortragender Legationsrat"") on November 1, 1935, with the rank of Minister in 1945. In mid-April 1947, Selchow moved to Wedel in Hamburgh. After the war Selchow maintained contact with some of his colleagues. Little is known about his abilities, but statements from personnel in other cipher bureaus imply that he was jealous and secretive. His Pers Z S staff characterized him as a ""competent administrator"" who knew little about cryptography and cryptanalysis. Selchow was somewhat of a Europhile and detested the Nazi Party. With the advent of Adolf Hitler in 1933 and Hermann Göring's Forschungsamt cipher bureau encroached upon the field of the Pers Z S, which was the interception and processing of diplomatic ciphers. Selchow at the time fervently wished to resign by was persuaded to stay by von Bülow, who until 1938 was Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, when he died. When Joachim von Ribbentrop, the new Foreign Minister, he lost a lot of supervisory power, and was restricted in duties. He was forced to join the Nazi Party in 1941. During World War II, he had no exact knowledge of the messages passed between different parties, and took no part in any matters pertaining to diplomacy. He remained head of the cipher bureau until May 1945.",Kurt Selchow,167
"Garlic oil

Garlic oil is the volatile oil (essential oil) derived from garlic. It is usually prepared using steam distillation, and can also be produced via distillation using ether. It is used in cooking and as a seasoning, a nutritional supplement, and also as an insecticide.

Garlic oil is typically prepared using steam distillation, whereby crushed garlic is steamed with the resultant condensation containing the oil. Garlic oil contains volatile sulfur compounds such as diallyl disulfide, which is the ""most abundant constituent"" of essential garlic oil. Steam-distilled garlic oil typically has a pungent odor and a yellow-brownish coloration. Its odor has been attributed to the presence of diallyl disulfide. To produce around 1 g of pure steam-distilled garlic oil, around 500 g garlic is required. Steam-distilled garlic oil has around 900 times the strength of fresh garlic, and around 200 times the strength of dehydrated garlic.

Ether can also be used to extract garlic oil. A type of garlic oil involves soaking diced or crushed garlic in vegetable oil, but this is not pure garlic oil; rather it is a garlic-infused oil.

Garlic oil is used as a nutritional supplement, and is sometimes purveyed in the form of capsules, which may be diluted with other ingredients. Some commercial preparations are produced with various levels of dilution, such as a preparation that contains 10% garlic oil. Some herbal folklore sources have stated that garlic oil possesses antifungal and antibiotic properties. It is also purveyed in health food stores as a digestive aid.

It can also be used as an insecticide, whereby it is diluted with water and sprayed on plants.

Stabilized garlic flavor blend is a proprietary mixture of dehydrated garlic powder infused with garlic oil, which increases the flavor of the garlic powder.

Garlic-flavored oil is produced and used for cooking and seasoning purposes, and is sometimes used as an ingredient in seasoning mixtures. This differs from essential garlic oil, and typically involves the use of chopped, macerated or crushed garlic placed in various vegetable oils to flavor the oil.",Garlic oil,168
"John Primrose (brewer)

John Primrose (c. 1803 – 28 November 1876) was a Scottish distiller and brewer who had a substantial career in South Australia. He was the founder of the Union Brewery in Rundle Street, the colony's first successful brewery.

Primrose was the son of a distiller in Cambridge, near Alloa. He was educated at the High School in Edinburgh, and on leaving school he joined his father's establishment, where he remained for some time, gaining sound practical and scientific knowledge of the arts of brewing and distilling. He gained further experience managing a distillery for the Messrs. Shea, of Belfast, then that of Beamish, in Cork. He remained with them for several years, only leaving them to establish a brewery on his own account on the Isle of Man.
He was then attracted to Australia, with the prospect of managing a large established distillery in Sydney.

Primrose arrived in South Australia aboard ""Ariadne"" in August 1839 and somehow never made it to Sydney. 
Shortly after his arrival he set up a distillery in partnership with John Richmond. 
After carrying it on for about two years he ceased operation on account of the Government demanding payment of duty upon all spirit manufactured in the colony, at the same rate as if it had been imported. 
Primrose then turned his attention to brewing, and in 1841 founded the Union Brewery in Rundle Street, which he carried on until a few years before his death, transferring the management to his nephew William Ross Sawers (c. 1839–1911) and Arthur Rait Malcom (c. 1847–1890), his son-in-law.

His remains were interred in the West Terrace Cemetery.

"Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification System

The Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantifications System (POP-Q), is a system of assessing the degree of prolapse of pelvic organs to help standardize diagnosing, comparing, documenting, and sharing of clinical findings. This assessment is used the most frequently. In the UK urologists can specialize in in female urology, The Baden–Walker Halfway Scoring System is used as the second most used system. More research publications related to pelvic organ prolapse use the POP-Q as the measure of pelvic organ prolapse.

Pelvic organ prolapse, when assessed using the POP-Q, identifies the prevalence of pelvic organ prolapse to be up to 50% while diagnosis by symptoms has a prevalence of 3–6 %. Some advocate that the system of assessment be modified.

The POP-Q was developed in 1996 and it quantifies the descent of pelvic organs into the vagina. The POP-Q provides reliable description of the support of the anterior, posterior and apical vaginal wall. It uses objective and precise distance measurements to the reference point, the hymen. Cystocele and prolapse of the vagina from other causes is staged using POP-Q criteria can range from good support (no descent into the vagina) reported as a POP-Q stage 0 or I to a POP-Q score of IV; which includes prolapse beyond the hymen. It also used to quantifies the movement of other structures into the vaginal lumen and their descent.

The POP-Q assessment tool measures nine points in the vagina. The hymen is the reference point to which the other points are compared. The prolapsed organs are measured in centimeters to the hymen. The measurements are taken when the Valsalva maneuver is performed by the woman while in the dorsal lithotomy position. The anatomical landmarks used are anterior vaginal wall, cervix, hymen, perineal body, total vaginal length, posterior vaginal wall and posterior fornix. A three by three centimeter grid is used to record the proximal and distal numbers. The information on the grid is translated to the appropriate stage of prolapse.

The evaluation of pelvic organ prolapse includes other diagnostic tests in addition to the POP-Q. These can be:
In the US, greater than 200,000 surgeries are performed each year for pelvic organ prolapse. Examples of pelvic organ prolapse are cystocele, rectocele, urethrocele, enterocele and sigmoidocele. Cystocele is the most common. This system of assessing pelvic organ prolapse is currently used widely in China and the US.

Other assessment tools are used to determine the impact of pelvic floor prolapse. These are Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire (PFIQ),The Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory (PFDI) and the shorter forms PFIQ-7 and PFDI-20.",Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification System,174

"Lying in a Hammock at William Duffy's Farm in Pine Island, Minnesota

""Lying in a Hammock at William Duffy's Farm in Pine Island, Minnesota"" is a poem by American poet James Wright. It is one of his best known poems, partially because of the tonal contrast between the content of the poem and its final line.

The poem was first published in ""The Paris Review"". It was later featured in a short story by Ann Beattie also published in ""The Paris Review"". The poem was included in Wright's collection ""This Branch Will Not Break"".

The poem is a description of a pastoral scene from the perspective of a person in a hammock. 

Much of the critical attention focused on the poem has concerned the last line. Dan Piepenbring, writing for ""The Paris Review"", summarized the criticism in a 2010 article:

Since [the poem's publication], that last line has inspired reams of analysis and debate—is it a lament? Is it a joke, a kind of boast? Did Wright intend to undercut or to bolster his pastoral scene with it? Could it be a winking response to Rilke, whose “Archaic Torso of Apollo” concludes with the imperative “You must change your life”?

Thom Gunn, in 1964, dismissed the line as ""...certainly meaningless. The more one searches for an explicit meaning in it, the vaguer it becomes. Other general statements of different import could well be substituted for it and the poem would neither gain nor lose strength."" Robert Bly, a friend of Wright, wrote in defense of the line a year later, and criticized Gunn for being unable to relate to the emotion expressed by the line.

David Mitchell has said that the line is a happy one, writing: ""...I hear him exhale it with a wry laugh"".

The line is discussed in Ann Beattie's short story ""Yancey"".

Wright acknowledged that he was influenced by Chinese poetry in writing ""Lying in a Hammock..."" in an interview with Dave Smith. This influence has been discussed by academics including Sven Birkerts.

The poem has been widely anthologized. It is one of David Mitchell's favorite pieces of writing.",Lying in a Hammock at William Duffy s Farm in Pine Island  Minnesota,177

After a bankruptcy in 2009 she returned two years later with a collection furniture, fabrics, lighting, jewelery and pictorial work. She designed the clothes for the opera La Traviata. The last ten years of her life she lived and worked in a converted watermill in Asbeek.

The designer overcame in 1989 a form of cancer. She died unexpectedly on 22 June 2012 pneumonia by pneumococcus. She is survived by two daughters. The months before her death she had a lot of projects in the pipeline. For example, she designed the uniforms for the cabin crew of Thomas Cook Airlines Belgium and there was the collection for the clothing chain JBC. For the fall of 2012 she was working on the costume design of the musical Peter Pan. Preparations for the sale of its archive at the end of June 2012 were in full swing.

And you don't really have to do anything to his music but just go ahead and play it."" Jones uses brushes on most of the tracks. ""A Sleeping Bee"" gets a ""gospel-inflected soul-jazz treatment"". ""This Time the Dream's on Me"" has ""a hip Latin vamp to introduce a soul-jazz-infused arrangement"". Mabern's arrangement of ""Savannah"" begins as a calypso and then shifts into hard bop.

"Starry Internet

Starry Internet is a fixed wireless broadband Internet service provider (ISP or WISP) operated by Starry, Inc., using millimeter-band LMDS connections, sometimes categorized as 5G fixed wireless, to connect its base stations to customer buildings.

Starry, Inc. was publicly announced in January 2016 by Chaitanya ""Chet"" Kanojia, who had previously founded Aereo. , it is providing commercial service to a limited number of apartment buildings in the Boston area for $50/month per apartment, promising 200Mbit/s upload and download speeds. , Starry was based in Boston, had about 100 employees, and had raised $63 million of funding. Kanojia claims that Starry's capital cost will be only $25 per home, as compared to $2,500 for cable.

Starry's system operates on the 38.2 GHz and 38.6 GHz bands, connecting its base stations (""Starry Beam"") to receivers on individual buildings (""Starry Points""). Each base station covers a radius of 1.5 km. Signal propagation is near line-of-sight, not penetrating buildings and windows, and is degraded by foliage or rain, so Starry directs its signal using Multi-user MIMO phased array antennas, and can take advantage of reflections. 

The base station redistributes its signal within a building using Starry's own Wi-Fi router (""Starry Station"").

Analysts are mixed about Starry's prospects. Some point to the failure of Clearwire (which operated WiMax on the 2.5 GHz band), or to technical challenges: ""The physics are tough to overcome, and technology has been slow to improve here."" Others note that if the expected low fixed costs per user are achieved, ""they could profitably offer competitive broadband speeds for a fraction of the current price of wired broadband"".

In January 2018, Starry announced they would be rolling out a beta version of their internet service in Los Angeles and Washington, DC later in the month.

"Cyrtoctenus

Cyrtoctenus is a genus of prehistoric eurypterid classified within the family Hibbertopteridae. The genus contains six species, ranging in temporal range from the Devonian to the Carboniferous.

""Cyrtoctenus wittebergensis"" is one of the few eurypterids known from the southern hemisphere, where eurypterid finds are rare and usually fragmentary.

""Cyrtoctenus"" was a gigantic Hibbertopterid eurypterid, with ""C. wittebergensis"" reaching lengths of around 1.5 meters. The anterior movable spines of the distal podomeres on the second, third and fourth prosomal appendages were modified to form ""fingers"" associated with fixed combs developed as modifications of the posterior spine.

""Cyrtoctenus"" had further adaptations towards sweep-feeding than other hibbertopterids, with its blades modified into comb-like rachis that could entrap smaller prey or other organic food particles. With its coxae being large, it is likely that ""Cyrtoctenus"" would also feed on relatively large invertebrates when able to.

It is believed that some of the genera within the Hibbertopteridae represent synonyms of each other. Four of the genera in the family, ""Campylocephalus"", ""Hastimima, Dunsopterus"" and ""Vernonopterus"" are clearly hibbertopterids but known from very incomplete specimens. Further discoveries may point to that some of them are synonymous with either ""Hibbertopterus"" or ""Cyrtoctenus"".

Furthermore, ""Cyrtoctenus"" and ""Hibbertopterus"" might represent different ontogenetic stages of each other, where rachis would have developed in the later moult stages. This would also explain why smaller ""Hibbertopterus"" specimens are more complete than the fragmentary remains known of ""Cyrtoctenus"", as the majority of ""Hibbertopterus"" specimens would represent exuviae whilst ""Cyrtoctenus"" specimens represent actual mortalities susceptible to scavengers.

The species currently seen as valid species of the genus are:",Cyrtoctenus,195

Many settlers left the area. Charles A. Dollner, a local merchant, suggested the rest of the people band together and build the fortification under leadership of two American Civil War veterans, Hans Juelson and Berge O. Lee.

"Jacob Richards (soldier)

Jacob Richards was an Irish soldier of the seventeenth century known for his service with the English Army. In the War of the Two Kings in Ireland he fought for William III agains the Jacobite Irish Army of James II. During the campaign he was Chief Engineer with charge of the Royal Artillery.

He was an Irish Protestant raised partly on his father's estates in County Wexford. His father Solomon Richards had served in the New Model Army under Oliver Cromwell.

In 1689 he oversaw the artillery bombardment during the Siege of Carrickfergus, where he was wounded three times. He was apparently present at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690 and at the decisive Siege of Limerick the next year.

In 1692 following the Treaty of Limerick which ended the Irish War, much of his force was redeployed to Flanders where William was leading an Allied Army against the French. His sons Jacob and Michael both oversaw the Artillery during the Battles of Steenkirk and Landen and went some way to establishing the traditions of the Royal Artillery.

He had three sons, all of whom pursued military careers. The eldest, also called Jacob, served as part of the Tangier Garrison and later with William of Orange in Flanders. He died in 1701. The second son John Richards converted to Catholicism. This led him to serve abroad in the Austrian Army. In 1703 during the War of the Spanish Succession he was commissioned into the Portuguese Army allied to Britain. He was killed at the Siege of Alicante in 1709. The youngest Michael Richards was appointed Chief Engineer of Great Britain in 1711.

His daughter Elizabeth married the English politician James Craggs.",Jacob Richards  soldier ,225

In summation he wrote, ""Since Johnny Mathis's recording debut, virtually everything has changed about the sound of music, not to mention the music industry. But Mathis has held steadfast to his core values as an artist, and as a 'singer's singer,' as he’s happily traversed from genre to genre.

"Fighting Cocks railway station

Fighting Cocks railway station was a railway station on the original course of the Stockton & Darlington Railway (S&DR) which served the villages of Middleton St George and Low Dinsdale in Darlington, part of the Ceremonial County of Durham, as well the once popular Dinsdale Spa Hotel from 1829.

When the Stockton & Darlington Railway first opened on 10 October 1825, there were no official stations as passenger trains were provided by independent coach operators who purchased a licence to the railway company to enable them to operate on the line. Tickets were therefore sold by local publicans and so it has been claimed that the Fighting Cocks public house, a coaching inn located adjacent to where the railway crossed Rykeneild Street, could be the oldest station booking office in the World. It was not until the success of passenger services on the Liverpool & Manchester Railway persuaded the S&DR to purchase the coach operators and in December 1833 it began to operate its own locomotive-hauled passenger service.

In 1829, the Dinsdale Spa Hotel was opened close to the village of Low Dinsdale which led to an increase in travel to the village using the railway. As a result a permanent station was opened during the 1830s (appearing in timetables by 1838), on the east side of the level crossing, to cater for this traffic. It was originally called 'Middleton and Dinsdale' but was renamed 'Fighting Cocks' in 1866.

In 1863 the S&DR was amalgamated into the North Eastern Railway (NER) who, on 1 July 1887 opened a new line from south of Darlington Bank Top station to Oak Tree Junction, east of Fighting Cocks station, to enable passenger services on the ex-S&DR route to serve Bank Top station. However the opening of this new route meant that Fighting Cocks was bypassed and so a new station was provided at to replace it. Over the course of its life as a passenger station, approximately 30,000 passenger tickets were sold to Fighting Cocks. From this point on Fighting Cocks was only served by goods trains until it was closed completely as an economy measure in 1964.

The line through the station remained as a through line until it was severed as the western end on 21 May 1967 though it was partially retained as a short branch line from Oak Tree Junction until the 1970s.

A public footpath now runs along the alignment of the railway through the sight of the station.",Fighting Cocks railway station,243

"Sculpture in Mexico

Sculpture is one of the oldest arts in Mexico. In Prehispanic Mexico, it is present in pyramids, sanctuaries, esplanades and communal objects; examples of this are the Olmec, Mayan, Teotihuacan, Tarascan, Mixtec and Aztec sculptures.

Many of these sculptures have been cataloged as masterpieces and stand out for their monumentality, since many of them are huge and exposed to be seen publicly.

Sculpture after the conquest is divided into two areas: decorative and statuary. Both were made in stone or wood. Plateresque art was essentially sculptural and in the Colony it produced important altarpieces. 

In the cathedral of Mexico, work Claudio Arciniega and Juan Miguel Agüero. It will become the paradigm of colonial architecture. Francisco Becerra will raise the cathedral of Puebla. Francisco Antonio Guerrero y Torres: Chapel of the Pocito, in the Villa de Guadalupe. In Puebla, a very active baroque school appears. Sanctuaries of Ocotlán in Tlaxcala, and of San Francisco de Acatepec, two magnificent examples of the Novohispano Baroque.

In all the colonial cities, fine finishes in the ornamentation and the facades of the churches can be appreciated. Oaxaca and its numerous temples like Soledad and Santo Domingo show the beauty and magnificence of it.

The academies created in Europe from the s17th century were founded on the rational abandoning the purely religious vision that had dominated the previous centuries. In New Spain, this philosophy sparked a reaction against the baroque. Thus, altarpieces that were essentially sculptural were considered overloaded and replaced by architectural manifestations. The central figure of this era in New Spain is the Spaniard Manuel Tolsá.

Romanticism tended to break the norms and strict models of classicism, as it pursued ideas influenced by realism and nationalism. Religious sculpture was reduced to sporadic imagery, while secular sculpture continued in portraits and monumental art of a civic nature.1

Between 1820 and 1880 the predominant themes were, successively: religious images, biblical scenes, allegories to the symbols of the insurgency movement and scenes and characters of pre-Cortesian history, and portraits of the old aristocracy, of the rising bourgeoisie and champions of the pre revolution. The transcendent sphere consisted in introducing civil reasons, the first national types and glimpses of a current of self expression.

Differentiated by its objectives and the emphasis of its theme, three currents emerged: an indigenist, archaic and folkloric; another, neoclassical, civic and historical; and a third, socialist, with ideological propaganda.

During the 20th century, great exponents of Mexican sculpture are Rómulo Rozo, Enrique Gottdiener Soto, Juan Soriano, José Luis Cuevas, Sebastián and Mathias Goeritz.",Sculpture in Mexico,246

Most of BambooHR's employees are salaried employees and do not qualify for overtime. BambooHR has an ""anti-workaholic policy"" in which employees are forbidden from laboring over a 40-hour week. Company co-founder Ryan Sanders' rationale was that occupational burnout has a detrimental effect on the health of his employees and negatively affects their families and his company.

"Ma'rib Campaign

The Ma'rib campaign was a campaign for control of the Ma'rib Governorate of Yemen, between the Houthis and Yemen Army units loyal to Ali Abdullah Saleh on one side, and militiamen and Yemen Army units loyal to Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi on the other side.

In September 2015, Saudi-backed Yemeni forces loyal to the government of Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi engaged Houthi forces and successfully established control over the eastern and western regions of Marib province. They took territory in Sirwah and Hareeb including the Hailan mountain, Al Ateef, Al Makhdarah, and Al Masaryah hill.

Mar'ib is of particular strategic importance in the conflict because it is a center for oil & gas production in Yemen; the powerplants of Mar'ib supply power to a significant part of the country and a gas pipeline passes south through Marib to the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea. The Safer Exploration and Production Operations Company and other foreign companies who work in the energy sector are based in Mar'ib. 45 Emirati soldiers, 10 Saudis and 5 Bahrainis were killed when a Houthi missile crashed into the coalition base at Safer in September 2015.

The 2015 missile strike marked an escalation in the conflict. In the months that followed, coalition air strikes targeted more civilian sites than military targets. During the 18 month period, between 26 March 2015 and 2 August 2016 there were nearly 500 attacks in Mar'ib, which was located at the frontline of the battle between coalation and Houthi forces. In 2016 the Yemen Data Project reported that Saudi air raids had hit a market in Sirwah twenty-four times.

In October, ""Xinhua"" reported that Houthi forces had killed Major General Abdel Rab al-Shadadi, a high-level pro-government commander. Several prominent Houthis, including militia leaders Hussain al-Mutawakel and Abu Jabar Ahmad al-Houthi, were captured by coalition forces. Coalition forces fought with Houthis for control over the route that runs from Yemen's capital Sanaa through Sirwah to Mar'ib.

US drone strikes were reported in early 2017 after the election of President Donald Trump. This marked the first U.S. engagement in Yemen since the failed Yakla raid. In November 2017 the ""New York Times"" reported that Mar'ib was ""an island of relative calm"".",Ma rib Campaign,284
"Pollia (gens)

The gens Pollia was a minor plebeian family at ancient Rome. The gens must have been very old, as one of the original Servian tribes was named after it, suggesting that the Pollii were important landowners during the Roman monarchy. However, few Pollii are mentioned in history, and none of them attained any of the higher offices of the Roman state. A number of Pollii are known from inscriptions. 

The nomen ""Pollius"" seems to be a patronymic surname derived from the old praenomen ""Paullus"", ""little"", which was little used in historical times, except in its feminine form, ""Paulla"", or as a cognomen, particularly by the great patrician house of the Aemilii. An alternative derivation would be from the surname ""Pollio"", originally referring to one who polished arms. Chase classifies ""Pollius"" among those gentilicia which either originated at Rome, or are not known to have come from anywhere else.

The Pollii used a variety of praenomina, especially ""Publius"", ""Gaius"", ""Marcus"", ""Gnaeus"", and ""Lucius"", all of which were very common throughout Roman history. Other names appear occasionally, including ""Quintus"" and ""Numerius"", of which the latter was widespread, but uncommon.",Pollia  gens ,285

"At North Farm

""At North Farm"" is a poem by American poet and writer John Ashbery. 

The poem first appeared in ""The New Yorker"" in 1984. It was the opening poem of Ashbery's 1984 collection ""The Wave"". It was written soon after Ashbery almost died due to an infection. 

The poem is in part a reference to the epic poem ""Kalevala"", which Ashbery revisited in his later poem ""Finnish Rhapsody"".

The poem loosely adheres to the form of a sonnet, with the traditional fourteen lines and the octet/seste of a Petrarchan sonnet. Adhering to the format was not intentional on Ashbery's part.

In her review of ""A Wave"", Helen Vendler wrote that the poem deals with the pains of aging using clichés.

The poem is evocative of W. H. Auden's work. Auden had an influence on Ashbery early poetry, an influence that diminished over the course of his career.

Although shorter and simpler than many of his most famous works, it is considered to be a well-known poem of Ashbery's.",At North Farm,303

"Hell (Hell album)

Hell is the fourth studio album by Salem-based doom metal project Hell. It was released on August 11, 2017 as a limited cassette through the label Sentient Ruin Laboratories and as a digital download through Hell's own label, LowerYourHead. ""Hell"" received critical acclaim from the few publications that covered it.

After Hell's trilogy of self-titled albums concluded in 2012 with ""Hell III"", frontman M.S.W. considered discontinuing the project. About the change of heart, he said:

""Hell"" is a doom metal album and, as such, is driven by slow, downtuned guitar riffs. Reviewer Shakeel Cox-Henry noted that the vocal styles on the album are ""very much alien"" to traditional doom metal, describing them as abrasive, tortured, and atonal. Operatic singing is incorporated on the closing track, ""Seelenos"", by Karli Mcnutt. In addition to the unusual vocals, Cox-Henry wrote that the songs are structured unconventionally, lacking predictable progression and varying often in tempo.

Another uncommon feature of ""Hell"" is its use of samples. The album's opening song, ""Helmzmen"", features the Mayday call of a doomed ship that sank in the Gulf of Alaska. The track ""Wandering Soul"" contains a sample that the US military used in a psychological weapon project against the Viet Cong in the Vietnam War. ""Hell's"" final track, ""Seelenos"", contains quotes from the works of Emily Dickinson.

The songs ""SubOdin"" and ""Inscriptus"" first appeared on Hell's 2015 self-titled EP.

""Hell"" received highly positive reviews. Writing for ""Metal Injection"", Cody Davis said, ""[""Hell's""] entirety results in what can only be described as one of the most enthralling albums to come out in 2017 and a strong album of the year candidate."" Shakeel Cox-Henry of ""Midlands Metalheads"" wrote, ""this album is strong, consistent, and most importantly, uses its resources to create an atmosphere of dereliction and suffering that only Hell could create."" ""Hell"" appeared as number 14 on ""Stereogum's"" 2017 year-end best metal albums list; Ian Chainey of that same publication called the album's execution ""top-notch"" and repeatedly praised its riffs.

Vermeer is a series of strategy and business simulation video games launched in 1987 by ariolasoft. It contained three individual games between the original launch and 2004: ""Vermeer"" (1987), ""Vermeer: Die Kunst zu erben"" (1997), and ""Vermeer: The Great Art Race"" (2004).

The name of the game series is reminiscent of the Dutch painter Jan Vermeer. The game title of the original game contained a graphic that is similar to his famous work ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"". In the game, however, the name stands for a fictional art forger named Vico Vermeer.

The action takes place in the 1920s. The game is playable in both single and multiplayer modes with up to 4 players (up to 5 in Vermeer 2). The aim of the game is to recover works of art which were lost in the first world war and which belong the players' dying uncle - the Berlin art collector Walter von Grünschild. Each player receives funding from the uncle which has to be increased by various means in order to enable the player to buy at auction various works of art as they come up for sale. The winner will inherit Walter von Grünschild's fortune and gain control of the corporate empire.

As the main source of income, the player engages in the acquisition of and trade in colonial goods. To this end, property is being acquired all over the world with up to twenty-four plantations for the cultivation of coffee, cocoa, silk, tea or tobacco. The harvested goods are then being sold at major trading venues in London and New York. Commodity forward transactions with individual customers are also possible. In addition, revenue can be generated through stock and foreign exchange trading and it is possible to win money at the racecourse.

With the assets generated, a total of 40 paintings belonging to the uncle's former collection can be acquired at auction. If a player does not have sufficient knowledge of art, he can easily end up with a counterfeit. Numerous deceptively genuine reproductions of the art forger Vico Vermeer are in circulation. In order to generate a game score, only real works or art are counted. Images of the forger Vico Vermeer are accepted by the uncle, as long as none of the other players can present the corresponding original. In order conceal the pictures players are chasing, players can choose to be represented by intermediaries at auction.

The global economic crisis and many other unforeseen events are troubling the players or offering opportunities and bringing him luck. Numerous gimmicks lighten up the game.

"1958 Mailuu-Suu tailings dam failure

The 1958 Mailuu-Suu tailings dam failure in the industrial town of Mailuu-Suu, (Kyrgyz: Майлуусуу), Jalal-Abad Region, southern Kyrgyzstan, caused the uncontrolled release of of radioactive waste. 

The event caused a number of direct casualties and widespread environmental damage. It was the single worst incident in a region of arid, mountainous western Kyrgyzstan, with a collection of shuttered Soviet-era uranium mining and processing sites, a legacy of extensive radioactive waste dumps, and a history of flooding and mudslides.

As of 2017, despite recent remediations funded by the World Bank and others, the treatment of radioactive waste at Mailuu-Suu still poses serious health and safety risks for local residents. 

Oil was discovered here in the early 1900s. Deposits of radium-bearing barites had been discovered by Alexander Fersman in 1929, during his national mineralogical resources survey for the new Soviet government. Uranium mining began in 1946, organized by the ""Zapadnyi Mining and Chemical Combine"". In addition to mining, two uranium plants would process more than of uranium ore, by ion exchange and alkaline leach, to produce uranium oxide for Soviet atomic bomb projects. The processed ore was both mined locally and imported from elsewhere in the Eastern bloc. 

The town was classified as one of the Soviet government's secret cities, officially known only as ""Mailbox 200"".

Uranium mining was halted in 1968. Operations left behind some 23 separate uranium tailings dams and 13 waste rock dumps, poorly designed on unstable hillsides above a town of 20,000 people in an area prone to both landslides and earthquakes, holding a total of material containing radionuclides and heavy metals. No attempt to stabilize or seal the material was done when Soviet mining ceased. 

On April 16, 1958, with mining and processing plants still operational, a combination of poor design, neglect, heavy rainfall and a reported earthquake caused the #7 tailings dam at Mailuu-Suu to fail. About 50% of the entire volume of the dam flowed into the swift Mailuu-Suu River, only downhill from the breach. The waste then spread about downstream across the national border into Uzbekistan then into the heavily populated Fergana Valley. The Mailuu-Suu River is a tributary of the Kara Darya, used for agricultural irrigation in the valley. 

Some fatalities, building destruction, and contamination of the flood plain were reported as the direct result of the mudflow. Lack of any public response by officials makes it difficult to identify fatalities from the April 1958 event, especially as distinguished from everyday exposure. 

Longterm health effects are more measurable. Grave threats to long-term residents persist, with residents experiencing far higher rates of cancer, goiter, anemia, and other illnesses related to radiological exposure.

Mailuu-Suu was found to be one of the 10 most polluted sites in the world in a study published in 2006 by the Blacksmith Institute.

Annual spring flooding and the lack of maintenance pose a continued threat of further releases of radioactive material. In 1994, a new landslide temporarily dammed the Mailuu-Suu River. In 2002 a flood caused by a mudslide nearly submerged a tailings pit. 

The World Bank approved a US$5 million grant to reclaim the tailings pits in 2004, and approved an additional $1 million grant for the project in 2011. The United Nations Development Programme, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development have also funded programs.",1958 Mailuu Suu tailings dam failure,389

"Alice Acheson

Alice Stanley Acheson (August 12, 1895 – January 20, 1996) was an American painter and printmaker.

Born in Charlevoix, Michigan, Acheson was the daughter of artist Jane C. Stanley and granddaughter of John Mix Stanley; her father Louis was a railroad lawyer. She grew up in Detroit. She majored in art at Wellesley College, where among her classmates was the sister of Dean Acheson, who introduced the couple; the two married in May 1917, the same month in which she graduated from college. She continued her artistic studies both before and after moving to Washington, D.C. with her husband, taking lessons at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Corcoran School of Art, and the school at the Phillips Collection. From 1919 she was active in as an artist in Washington, eventually joining and exhibiting with the Society of Washington Artists, from which she received an honorable mention in 1940; she was also an active member of the Washington Water Color Club, the Artists Guild of Washington, and the National Association of Women Artists. For the duration of World War II she abandoned painting to pursue agriculture in support of the war effort, also teaching painting and drawing to wounded servicemen at the Forest Glen annex of Walter Reed Army Medical Center. She took it up again when her husband was appointed United States Secretary of State, but she refused to exhibit until he returned to private life, feeling she would be using his fame to further her own career. Acheson was described as a fashionable woman who, though she took scant interest in foreign affairs, was devoted to her husband and would defend him against any ill feeling. The couple were the parents of three children, all of whom survived her, as did six grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. She was also noted for her passion for Scrabble and for her independent spirit, at 85 telling off a teenage mugger who attempted to rob her. Acheson died at her home in Washington, and was buried in Oak Hill Cemetery alongside her husband.

Acheson worked in pastels, watercolor, and oils during her career, progressing from a representational style to something approaching abstraction. Four of her works are in the collection of the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, part of the original bequest by Joseph Hirshhorn; they include a still-life in oil, dated before 1956; an undated landscape in oil; a 1975 watercolor view of Phnom Penh; and a 1970 collage titled ""The City"". Two undated watercolors are owned by the Smithsonian American Art Museum. Other pieces are owned by the Phillips Collection, the National Museum of Women in the Arts, and the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum. Her work was formerly in the collection of the Corcoran Gallery of Art, and may be found as well at American University and in the Barnett-Aden Collection. Several of her linoleum cut prints were used to illustrate ""New Roads in Old Virginia"" by Agnes Rothberg in 1937. A vertical file pertaining to Acheson's work is at the library of the Phillips Collection; other papers may be found with her husband's private documents at the Yale University Library. She is also featured in some materials held among her husband's official papers at the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum.",Alice Acheson,417

Demirdjian published a 2005 paper with Rodney Dixon, a member of Association of Defence Counsel of the ICTY, about plea-bargaining at the ICTY, where they noted that defense attorneys advising clients must be extremely resourceful in exploring all possible grounds for mitigation given the broad discretionary powers of the Trial Chambers. They noted that sentence reductions were unlikely due to the serious nature of the crimes brought before the Trial Chambers, adding that in most cases, the Trial Chambers would follow the recommendations of the OTP. They identified several key ""mitigating circumstances"" including the resources of the tribunal, protecting the interests of the victims and a genuine admission of guilt.

"The Forgotten: It Begins

The Forgotten: It Begins is a 1999 non-violent adventure/puzzle video game developed by Ransom Interactive and published by DreamCatcher Interactive. A sequel was to be released called The Forgotten II: The Collection. ""The Forgotten"" narrative was originally supposed to last over 7 games (""modules""), but these were never completed.

The concept of serialisation was decided early on in the development of ""The Forgotten"" storyline in 1995 - a franchise that runs over seven games (""modules""). The genre of game was due to the response from customers regarding Dreamcatcher's earlier titles ""Beyond Time"" and ""Jewels of the Oracle"", which expressed a desire for ""non-violent, adventure/puzzle style games"".

The website went live on October 19, 1999. The unreleased game , announced on October 21, 1999, was to be based on a character from ""The Forgotten""; a multi-level demo was planned for E3 in the spring of 2000, but did not materialize. The game shipped on November 15, 1999 to EBX, Babbages, Microcenter and other stores, and could also be purchased online off Dreamcatcher Games Online Store.

""The Forgotten II: The Collection"" picked up where the original left off plot-wise. The narrative was originally supposed to be covered in 7 games; by April 2000, complete storyline for all seven modules had been fully developed, and the story arcs and puzzles for Episodes 2 and 3 were completed. At this time, the modeling and artwork has begun, and the game interface had been reworked to allow for larger panoramas and puzzles. A new gaming engine was also being developed for better flexibility and performance in Forgotten II and future games. The first two titles were to be released on single CDs, while the 3rd-7th were to be targeted for DVD. 

The objective of the game is to find Richard Haliburton, who has gone missing in the city of New Orleans.

While critics appreciated the game's atmosphere and approachability, as well as its intriguing premise, the game was also criticized for its short length and poorly-developed story. Others criticized the game's lack of urgency or danger.",The Forgotten  It Begins,430

"Thomas Francis Hyland

Thomas Francis Hyland (c. 1831 – 1 March 1920) was a businessman of Victoria, Australia, instrumental in turning Penfolds Wines from a cottage industry to an Australian icon.

Thomas Francis Hyland was born in Ireland, the youngest son of John Hyland, of Ballinamallard, Ireland.
He migrated to Australia at the time of the gold rush, worked at the diggings, and in 1853 gained employment as a warder at Pentridge Stockade then the hulk ""President"", was promoted to chief warder of the hulk ""Success"", was transferred to Collingwood Stockade, then governor of Portland Gaol, finally to become around 1868 the notoriously hard-driving governor of Castlemaine Gaol.

On 24 September 1862, he married Mary Georgina Anne ""Georgina"" Penfold, only child of Dr. Christopher Rawson Penfold (2 August 1811 – 26 March 1870) and Mary Penfold, née Holt (1816 – 31 December 1895) of ""The Grange"", Magill.
The Hylands' daughter Inez Kathleen Hyland was born 16 August 1863, and from age eight lived with her grandmother at The Grange, Magill. She was not a strong child, and her parents believed the clear air and moderate climate of Magill would be beneficial to her health. A strong bond grew between the two: Inez was a brilliant and imaginative child and Mary encouraged her writing, especially her poetry. Even well into her late 20s, Inez seems to have no other life; perhaps she was an invalid. She died from typhoid fever on 11 January 1892, and Mary left for Melbourne shortly after, never to return. She published a collection of her granddaughter's work, as ""In Sunshine and in Shadow"" in 1893, which received some excellent, if mixed, reviews.
Hyland recommended to Mary Penfold, presumptuously some reckon, that she sell the business and retire, a not unrealistic suggestion, as the property and business had become quite valuable and the sale would enable her to live in comfort indefinitely, but she was adamant: the winery was her life, and like Ann Bickford twenty years earlier, determined to keep alive the business her husband started.
Another reading could be that Hyland, who would have known his mother-in-law well, was offering his moral support whichever route she chose.

On 14 September 1881 they signed an arrangement: that Hyland should be Penfolds' accountant and their marketing agent for Victoria, where he would continue to live, leaving Mary to run the winery, and receive 10% of profits.
Hyland, who had in 1876 taken 12 months' leave of absence in 1876 preparatory, it was thought, to retiring, finally retired from Castlemaine Gaol and the Penal Department in 1883.

Mary died in 1895; the following year some members of the family adopted the style ""Penfold Hyland"", recognising the importance of the name ""Penfold"". It later frequently appeared in print hyphenated as ""Penfold-Hyland"", but with what justification it is difficult to ascertain.

Under Hyland's guidance, the company established vineyards and wineries at McLaren Vale and Nuriootpa in South Australia, and Dalwood and Minchinbury in New South Wales and offices in Adelaide, Sydney, Melbourne, Perth, and London. His son Frank Hyland managed the business in Sydney and Leslie Hyland in Adelaide

Georgina died at home on 27 August 1911 aged 67, and her remains were interred at Brighton General Cemetery. Thomas Francis Hyland also died at home, at the age of 88 years.

Thomas Francis Hyland (c. 1831 – 1 March 1920) married (Mary) Georgina Penfold (1835 – 27 August 1911) on 1861. Their family included:

"William Sturgis Hinckley

William Sturgis Hinckley (died 1846) was alcalde and captain of the port of Yerba Buena, California — present day San Francisco, at the time a part of Mexico — from 1844 to 1846. He was born in Hinhgam, Massachusetts, and was a nephew of William Sturgis, a Boston merchant. In the 1830s he was owner and captain of ships plying the California hide trade with the Hawaiian Islands. After his first wife died in Massachusetts in 1840, he became a permanent resident of Yerba Buena, taking Mexican citizenship in 1942 and marrying Ygnacio Martinez's daughter Susana. He enjoyed a close friendship with Juan Bautista Alvarado, and helped him in his efforts to secure the governorship of Alta California against a competing claim from Carlos Antonio Carrillo.

He was elected alcalde in 1844, and in that year ordered the construction of a bridge across the creek between San Francisco Bay and a small saltwater lagoon lying at what is now the intersection of Montgomery and Jackson Streets. This modest construction was regarded as a novelty by many residents at the time, who had formerly had to wade tidal muds or jump across the creek to travel between the settled area to the south and ship embarkments to the north.

His term as alcalde ended January 1, 1846, and he died in June of that year.",William Sturgis Hinckley,435

"Salawat al-Sha'baniyya

Al-Ṣalawāt al-Shaʿbānīyya (Arabic: اَلصَّلَوات الشَّعبانِيَّة) is regarded as a supplication which was quoted from the fourth Imam of Shia Islam, Imam al-Sajjad.

The following text is considered as the translation of the initial part of Salawat Sha'baniyya.

""O Allah: (please do) send blessings upon Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad— the tree of Prophethood; and the trustees of the (Divine) Mission; and the frequently visited by the angels; and the core of knowledge; and the Household of the Divine Revelation.

O Allah: (please do) send blessings upon Muhammad and the Family of Muhammad— the sailing ships through the abysmal waves. He who embarks on them will be saved, but he who abandons them will be drowned.""

"Beyond Time

Beyond Time aka Shadow of the Obelisk: Delve Into the Corridors of Time is a 1997 full motion video adventure game developed by Jones and Jones Multimedia and published by DreamCatcher Interactive.

The background of Jones and Jones Multimedia employees included theatre, fiction, literature, and art, and the company's video game output (including this game) combined these aspects together. They aimed to include genuine rt and historical information to make it appealing and long-lasting. They set the game in locations that had an air of mystery and fascination. The team spent more than a year doing art history research to have a better understanding of the architectural worlds which were being created in the game. They turned their research into 3D representations; while they didn't recreate existing structures, they incorporated elements that they observed. The team aimed to add 2D animation and sound effects to as many screens as possible to give a sense of a lived-in world, for instance a bird flying across the sky. A unique game engine was made for the title.

Quandary thought the game's short length let it down. Just Adventure and Adventure Gamers described the game as a watered-down ""Timelapse-""type experience. Game Revolution thought the graphics were underwhelming. Adventure Classic Gaming criticised the game's ""plodding, chatty, confused storyline"".

"Oman–Saudi Arabia relations

Oman–Saudi Arabia relations refers to the current and historical relations between Sultanate of Oman and Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Oman has an embassy in Riyadh and a consulate in Jeddah, whilst Saudi Arabia has an embassy in Muscat.

Two nations have a long historical relationship between two states. Both are members of the Gulf Cooperation Council and mainly adhere to Islam, although Oman is Ibadi Islam while Saudi Arabia is Wahhabi Islam. As such, unlike radical approach of Saudi Arabia, Oman has a moderate and friendly approach, which makes Oman capable to handle the political hardship between Saudi Arabia and several nations, especially Iran.

The two countries share a long border only behind Saudi-Yemen border.

The Khawarij, a radical Islamic group formed after the death of Prophet Muhammad in what would be today Saudi Arabia, was responsible for the revolt against Caliph Ali. However, some of them, following the more moderate and disagreed with the Khawarij, refused the authority of Khawarij and moved into South Arabia, which would be today Oman. Thus, the moderate party formed the Ibadi movement, in which later became the core of Omani culture. The Ibadi is the only surviving force of the Khawarij movement.

As both Oman and Saudi Arabia's modern political approach formed amidst the withdrawal of British Armed Forces, they established relationship at 1971. However, Oman has chosen a moderate approach in political agenda in comparing to Saudi Arabia. Oman has been acting as a mediator that keeping relationship with Iran when Iran has tensions with other Arab countries, and since then has become a bridge connecting relationship between two countries. Also, Oman doesn't participate in the Saudi-led coalition at the Yemeni Civil War.

"Old Wolfstein Castle

Old Wolfstein Castle (, also called the ""Altes Schloß""), is a ruined hillside castle on the eastern slopes of the Königsberg at the narrowest point in the Lauter valley near Wolfstein in the county of Kusel in the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate.

Old Wolfstein was probably built under Emperor Frederick Barbarossa around 1160/70 to guard and administer the Imperial Estate around Kaiserslautern.

The castle is first recorded in 1275 as ""Woluistein"". At that time it was occupied by imperial ""ministeriales"".

In the 14th century the castle acted as security (""Pfandobjekt""), and, as an imperial pledge (""Reichspfand""), ended up in the possession of the counts of Sponheim and counts of Veldenz. Baldwin of Luxembourg made several unsuccessful attempts to acquired the castle through an imperial mortgage (""Reichspfandschaft"").

Repeated raids on the castle defenders, who came from Sponheim ""ministeriales"" families, led to armed conflicts. In 1362 the Bishop of Speyer occupied the castle; in 1400 the Archbishops of Mainz and Trier, the Duke of Lorraine and Count Palatine Rupert III besiegd the castle. As a consequence, Electoral Palatinate received a quarter of the castle.

In the 15th and 16th centuries, Electoral Palatinate and the Duchy of Zweibrücken fought for possession of the castle.
The dispute ended in 1504 with its destruction by Prince-Elector Philip of the Palatinate. After that, Old Wolfstein was allowed to fall into ruin.

In the 19th and 20th centuries the ruins came into the possssion of the Kingdom of Bavaria and, since 1963, have been managed by the Castle Authorities of Rhineland-Palatinate (""Schlösserverwaltung von Rheinland-Pfalz""). The latter carried out safety work on the walls in the years 1979 to 1981 and 1985 to 1986. The remains of the castle ruins include a 20-metre-high ""bergfried"".

From the platform of the pentangular ""bergfried"" there is a very good view of the surrounding area. The walls of the small cast are a well preserved example of High Hohenstaufen architecture. Another feature of this design is the elongated tip of the side of the ""bergfried"" facing the likely direction of attack. To the north of the ruins on a steep hillside is rubble from an old wall, which is evidence of the formerly, lower lying outer ward of the castle. From 1961 to 1975 remains of a castle residence (""Burghaus""), a gate tower and a water well were uncovered.

A close observation of the interior wall of the ruined ""bergfried"" reveals at a certain height the handle and rear part of a trowel. This tool was probably embedded there by workmen in memory of a colleague who fell and was killed during restoration work. This trowel is supposed to have been worked into the wall at the exact height from which the man fell (the exact date must be before 1970, but cannot be more precisely estimated).",Old Wolfstein Castle,484

Saudi Arabia–Tunisia relations refers to the bilateral relations between Saudi Arabia and Tunisia.

Two countries share historical commons, as both are majority Sunni Muslims and their Arabic heritages. Despite of this, Saudi Arabia and Tunisia nonetheless have political differences. Saudi Arabia is a conservative Kingdom while Tunisia is a liberal Republic. However, two countries have engaged in larger cooperations in order to exert Saudi influence.

Saudi Arabia has en embassy in Tunis, whilst Tunisia maintains embassy in Riyadh and a consulate in Jeddah.

The Arab conquest at 7th century had brought Tunisia into an Islamic sphere. A mosque, which is regarded as the third holiest place in the Islamic world, the Great Mosque of Kairouan, was built in Tunisia.

Both two nations have increased significant cooperation since the independence of Tunisia from France. The Saudi Kingdom has attempted to increase their Islamic doctrine into Tunisia for several years recently.

After the Tunisian Revolution in 2011, which ousted President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, Saudi Arabia has granted asylum for Zine Ben Ali, who himself is a long time friend for the Saudis, while supports Tunisia on their track of recovery. Nonetheless, new Tunisian Government has shown unhappiness towards Saudi Arabia's decision to grant Ben Ali's asylum and has demanded the Saudi Government to extradite back to Tunisia for trials.",Saudi Arabia–Tunisia relations,487

"Dora Fabian

Dora Fabian (1901–1935) was a German socialist and anti-Nazi activist.

She was the daughter of Else Levy Heinemann and a socialist lawyer who defended Trade Unionists and political activists in court. This environment nurtured her interest in politics and during the First World War she became a member of the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany.

In 1924 she married Walter Fabian a fellow social democratic activist.

She became disillusioned with the politics of the Social Democratic Party of Germany and joined the Socialist Workers' Party of Germany.

After being detained by the Nazis in March 1933, she decided to leave Germany than risk re-arrest. She fled first to Prague, then Paris, finally arriving in London on 8 September 1933. She had an invitation from John Paton a leading figure in the Independent Labour Party. She had sufficient funds to be allowed to stay for a month with the previso she did not work.

She was found dead alongside Mathilde Wurm in their London flat in Guilford Street on 4 April 1935. The inquest attracted a great deal of interest and was attended by Fenner Brockway, James Maxton, Ben Riley as well as by Ernst Toller, who travelled from Paris to attend. Karl Korsch was a witness, having been in a relationship with Fabian. Indeed he had ended the relationship and this was used as an argument to suggest that Fabian was suffering from depression. When the verdict came it was that the two women had ""committed suicide while of unsound mind"". However, this was not accepted by many members of the German anti-Nazi refugee community or their British supporters.

This incident features in the novel ""All That I Am"" by Anna Funder.",Dora Fabian,503
"Dora Saker

Dora Glover Saker (1888 - 1 July 1926) was an instructor in cheese-making for Somerset County Council. The rediscovery of her book, ""Practical Cheddar Cheese-making"" (1917), by cheese-makers in the twenty-first century has been credited with inspiring a revival of interest in historic cheese-making methods and to have ""quickly acquired cult status amongst farmhouse cheese-makers"".

Dora Saker was born in Redhill, Surrey, England, in 1888, to Richard Webb Saker, a solicitor's clerk, and his wife Hannah C. Saker. She had two sisters and two brothers.

Bronwen Percival and Randolph Hodgson describe Saker as working during a period when methods of dairy production were becoming more scientific with farmers, colleges and instructors co-operating to ensure that local cheese producers were able to make a consistently high-quality product.

In 1908 Saker passed the examinations of the National Agricultural Examination Board and was awarded the National Diploma in Dairying (NDD). She also qualified as BDFD. She was appointed as an instructor in cheese-making for Somerset County Council and in 1917 published her first book, ""Practical Cheddar Cheese-making"" which emphasised the importance of good hygiene and the correct alignment of acidification with moisture loss in the production process. She advocated farmhouse over factory production as in her view the former allowed a better control to be kept over the quality of the ingredients and the making process. In 1919 she was appointed cheese examiner at Chelmsford, and in 1920 she was appointed examiner in cheese-making at the examinations of the British Dairy Farmers Association in Reading. In that year she held the position of Superintendent of Dairy Poultry and Domestic Science to the Somerset Agricultural Instruction Committee. In 1921 she published her second book, ""Practical Dairying"", in Methuen's Handbooks of Agriculture series. In 1923 she travelled to New York on the ship ""Celtic"".

Saker died at a hospital in Bridgwater, Somerset, on 1 July 1926. Her residence was recorded as The Somerset Farm Institute, Cannington, Bridgwater. She left an estate of £1,575. Probate was granted to her sisters Margaret May Saker and Ida Marion Saker.

Saker's book on Cheddar cheese-making was rediscovered in the early twenty-first century and has been credited with inspiring a revival of interest in historic cheese-making methods. According to Percival and Hodgson, the book has ""quickly acquired cult status amongst farmhouse cheese-makers"" but they caution against seeing her advice as the rediscovery of a lost traditional way of cheese-making, arguing that there is no such thing and that Saker was very progressive in her views and seeking to improve the quality of the product through the application of scientific techniques.",Dora Saker,504

"Hundred of Nuriootpa

The Hundred of Nuriootpa is a cadastral unit of hundred in the County of Light, South Australia split between in the eastern Adelaide Plains and western Barossa Valley. Named in 1847 for an indigenous term officially thought to mean ""bartering place"" and traditionally used as neutral ground for trading between various indigenous tribes, it is bounded on the south and east by the North Para River.
The town of Nuriootpa is at the north eastern corner of the hundred. Other towns within the hundred are Freeling, whose the southern and oldest parts straddle the north border of the hundred, and Greenock, also in the hundred's north. The localities of Nain, Kingsford, Shea-Oak Log, Daveyston, Seppeltsfield, Marananga, Stone Well and Gomersal as well as parts of Templers, Roseworthy, Concordia, Rosedale, Lyndoch, Rowland Flat and Tanunda are also within the hundred.

The hundred borders on the greater Adelaide conurbation with the Gawler suburb of Hewett and parts of the suburbs of Gawler East and Gawler South also lying within the hundred at the south-western corner near the North Para's confluence with the South Para River.

Apart from the very small portion of land occupied by the Town of Gawler at the south-western corner of the hundred, the earliest local government in the hundred was established in 1867 with the establishment of the District Council of Nuriootpa, spanning the remainder of the hundred. In 1892 the Nuriootpa council annexed a portion of the District Council of Light to the north-west, bringing the township of Freeling (on the hundred's north border) under the governance of a single body. In 1910 the township of Nuriootpa in the hundred's north-east corner was annexed by the District Council of Angaston but the vast bulk of the hundred remained under the governance of the Nuriootpa council. In 1918 the Nuriootpa council changed its name to Freeling in line with the location of the council seat.

In 1977 Freeling and Mudla Wirra council (to the west) were amalgamated to form the new District Council of Light (the second of that name). In 1996 the Light council amalgamated with the District Council of Kapunda (to the north) to form the present-day Light Regional Council. The Nuriootpa township portion of the hundred at the north-east corner remained under the governance of Angaston council until 1996 when Angaston was amalgamated with Tanunda and the old Barossa district councils to form the present-day Barossa Council.",Hundred of Nuriootpa,506

A beak-spouted ewer (German: ""Schnabelkanne"") is a ewer, jug, pitcher or flagon with a spout formed in the shape of a beak.

Beak-spouted ewers were initially made and used by the Etrurians. The Celts imported some of these vessels and started to copy them. They developed variants according to their liking. The containers were either made from bronze or from clay.

Famous Celtic beak-spouted ewers have been found at the Glauberg in Hessia and the Dürrnberg near Hallein in Austria. A modern variant was made by the Workshop of Christian Knütgen (active 1568–1605) in Siegburg (Germany), 1597 and is now kept at The Metropolitan Museum of Art.",Beak spouted ewer,537
"Prasophyllum suttonii

Prasophyllum suttonii, commonly known as the mauve leek orchid, Mount Buffalo leek orchid or Buffalo leek-orchid, is a species of orchid endemic to the Australian Alps. Some authorities list the species as being a Victorian endemic now extinct whilst others list is as occurring in New South Wales and extant. Descriptions of the species also differ. It has a single tube-shaped leaf and up to thirty five white flowers with purple or mauve marks.

According to the National Herbarium of New South Wales, ""Prasophyllum suttonii"" is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single tube-shaped leaf up to long. Up to thirty five fragrant, crystalline white flowers with purple or mauve marks are crowded along a flowering stem which reaches to a height of . As with others in the genus, the flowers are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is egg-shaped to lance-shaped and up to long. The lateral sepals are up to long and usually free from each other, sometimes joined by a thin membrane. The petals are shaped like a spatula up to long. The labellum is broad lance-shaped to egg-shaped, about long and wide and turns sharply upwards near its middle, extending above the lateral sepals. The upturned edges of the labelled are crinkled or folded and there is a green, channelled callus along the centre of the labellum. Flowering occurs from January to March.

The Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria and David Jones describe the species as having fewer flowers on the flowering stem, each with most of the flower organs smaller and appearing in December.

""Prasophyllum suttonii"" was first formally described in 1912 by Richard Sanders Rogers and Bertha Rees and the description was published in ""Proceedings of the Royal Society of Victoria"" from a specimen collected on Mount Buffalo. The specific epithet (""suttonii"") honours Charles Stanford Sutton, a medical practitioner, amateur botanist and long-time member of the Field Naturalists Club of Victoria.

The mauve leek orchid grows in wet bogs in alpine and subalpine heath and grassland, mainly in the Kosciuszko National Park in New South Wales. Victorian authorities list the species as endemic to that state and ""Presumed Extinct"", not having been collected since 1902.

"Rosh HaAyin South railway station

Rosh HaAyin South railway station is a railway station near Rosh HaAyin, Israel. Despite the name, it is located north-west of the city, near the historic site of Antipatris (Tel Afek).

The station no longer serves passengers, but it remains operational as a freight terminal, and there are plans to reinstate the passenger service.

Ras al-Ayn railway station was built in 1915 by the Ottoman authorities in Palestine as part of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of World War I. To allow rapid deployment of their troops southward, the Turks built the Eastern Railway from Afula, where it connected to Jezreel Valley railway, southwards via Jenin and Tulkarm to Lydda, where it connected to the Jaffa–Jerusalem railway and the Railway to Beersheba. The line was built as narrow gauge (1050 mm) like the rest of the Ottoman railways in the region, and was situated relatively inland to avoid the reach of naval guns from Royal Navy warships patrolling the Mediterranean coast.

After the British conquered the area, they converted the Eastern Railway to standard gauge and extended it further northwards via Hadera, connecting Haifa with Lydda for onward journey west to Jaffa, east to Jerusalem, or south via Gaza City to El Kantara, Egypt. Thus, Ras al-Ayn railway station became part of the Palestine Railways main line. In 1921, a branch line was built from Ras al-Ayn station westwards to Petah Tikva.

During the 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine, Jewish passengers on southbound main line trains alighted at Ras al-Ayn and changed onto buses, in order to avoid passing through Lod.

In 1946, Irgun militants bombed the station building, which at this time was mainly used by British troops stationed in the area. The city of Rosh HaAyin, founded in 1949, later became the main settlement served by the station, and so the station was renamed.

After the establishment of State of Israel, the branch line to Petah Tikva railway station, dubbed Yarkon Railway, was extended further westwards, reaching Tel Aviv North railway station in 1949, and later connected to the Coastal Railway in 1953.

When the passenger service on the Eastern Railway ceased in 1969, Rosh HaAyin railway station was closed. Yet, on 3 June 2000, the station reopened as the eastern terminus of the new Yarkon Railway passenger service between Tel Aviv and Rosh HaAyin. In 2003, this service was extended into Hod HaSharon; for this, a new connection between Yarkon Railway and Eastern Railway was built, which avoided the need to reverse the train at Rosh HaAyin. The old Rosh HaAyin station thus remained inaccessible to the extended service, and the new Rosh HaAyin North railway station opened on 13 September 2003 at a location about 2 km north of the old one. Since then, Rosh HaAyin South railway station is only used by the freight services between the north of Israel and Lod, in order to bypass the congested Ayalon Railway.

The government of Israel announced plans to revive the Eastern Railway at a projected cost of NIS 8 billion (appx. US$ 2.2 billion), reinstating a service from Haifa via Hadera and Rosh HaAyin to Lod which would bypass the congested Coastal railway. The rebuilt Rosh HaAyin South railway station would be connected to the city with a footbridge over Highway 6. However, the construction is not expected to start before 2020.",Rosh HaAyin South railway station,545

Lake Lichen is formed by an enlargement of the Opawica River and integrates into Wachigabau Lake which includes a dam at its mouth.

The northwestern portion of the Lichen Lake hydrographic slope is accessible through the forest road route 113 passing north-west of Opawica Lake and connecting Chibougamau to Lebel-sur-Quévillon. The north side of the lake is accessible via the Canadian National Railway which passes over a strip of land between Opawica Lake and Wachigabau Lake.

The surface of Lichen Lake is usually frozen from early November to mid-May, however, safe ice movement is generally from mid-November to mid-April.

Formed by a widening of the Opawica River, this lake has a length of , a maximum width of and an altitude of . The shape of the lake looks like a big Z spilled and lying on its side. The southwestern part of the lake has an extension of where the Céré Lake outlet discharges.

"Zadeh's Rule

In mathematical optimization, Zadeh's rule (also known as Least-entered rule) is an algorithmic refinement of the simplex method for linear optimization.

The rule was proposed around 1980 by Norman Zadeh, and has entered the folklore of convex optimization since then. 

Zadeh offered a reward of $1,000 to anyone who can show that the rule admits polynomially many iterations or to prove that there is a family of linear programs on which the pivoting rule requires subexponentially many iterations to find the optimum.

Zadeh formulated his offer in a letter to Victor Klee:

Zadeh's rule belongs to the family of history-based improvement rules which, during a run of the simplex algorithm, retain supplementary data in addition to the current basis of the linear program.

In particular, the rule chooses among all improving variables one which has entered the basis least often, intuitively ensuring that variables that might yield a substantive improvement in the long run but only a small improvement in a single step will be applied after a linear number of steps.

The supplementary data structure in Zadeh's algorithm can therefore be modeled as an occurrence record, mapping all variables to natural numbers, monitoring how often a particular variable has entered the basis. In every iteration, the algorithm then selects an improving variable that is minimal with respect to the retained occurrence record.

Note that the rule does not explicitly specify which particular improving variable should enter the basis in case of a tie.
Zadeh's rule has been shown to have at least super-polynomial time complexity in the worse-case by constructing a family of Markov Decision Processes on which the policy iteration algorithm requires a super-polynomial number of steps.

Running the simplex algorithm with Zadeh's rule on the induced linear program then yields a super-polynomial lower bound.

The result was presented at the Mathematical Optimization Society's Integer Programming and Combinatorial Optimization conference in 2011 by Oliver Friedmann. Zadeh, although not working in academia anymore at that time, attended the conference and honored his original proposal.",Zadeh s Rule,572

Igor Golomstock (11 January 1929 - 12 July 2017) was a London-based Russian art historian. He was the author of several books about Western artists like Pablo Picasso, Hieronymus Bosch, Paul Cézanne, Hans Holbein and Damien Hirst. In ""Totalitarian Art"", he contended that totalitarian art looked the same regardless of the regime.

Igor Golomstock was born on 11 January 1929 in Kalinin, Soviet Union (now Tver, Russia). After his Karaite Jew father, Naum Kojak, was sent to a gulag, his parents divorced and Igor took his mother's name. From 1939 to 1943, as he was a teenager, Golomstock and his mother lived in Kolyma, a labour camp in the Russian Far East.

Golomstock graduated from Moscow University, where he studied art history.

Golomstock began his career by working for the Soviet Ministry of Culture. He was also a resident scholar at the Pushkin Museum, and he taught art history at his alma mater, Moscow University. After emigrating to the United Kingdom in 1972, he taught art history at University of Essex, the University of St Andrews and the University of Oxford. In 1977, he ""co-curated the exhibition ""Unofficial Art from the Soviet Union"" at the Institute of Contemporary Arts"" in London. He subsequently worked as a radio presenter on the ""BBC Russian Service"".

Golomstock was the author of several books. His first book, co-written with Andrei Sinyavsky, was about Pablo Picasso. His other books were about Hieronymus Bosch, Paul Cézanne, Hans Holbein and Damien Hirst. He was best-known for ""Totalitarian Art"", first published in 1990 and republished in 2011, in which he contended that totalitarian art looked the same regardless of the regime. In particular he showed that both Nazism and Stalinism depicted ""industrious families, idealistic soldiers and compassionate leaders."" Golomstock found similar features in Fascist and Maoist art.

Ben Aryeh Debby has published numerous scientific papers and has supervised Ph.D. and master's students. In her research, she is showing how the knowledge of history will help us to understand art.

Her first book """"Renaissance Florence in the Rhetoric of Two Popular Preachers: Giovanni Dominici (1356-1419) and Bernardino da Siena (1380-1444)"""" focuses on historical research of Dominican and Franciscan preachers and analyzes sermons. It also includes a large, critical edition of an unpublished manuscript of mendicant sermons.

Her second book """"The Renaissance Pulpit: Art and Preaching in Italy, 1400-1550"""" which appeared in Italian as ""Il Pulpito Toscano tra 300 e 500"". Roma: Istituto Poligrafico e Zecco: 2009, addresses visual material and examines the relationship between preaching and art, i.e., the use of works of art in sermons and the pulpit itself. It examines sculpted marble pulpits from an interdisciplinary perspective focusing on the connections between art, literature and religion.

Her third book """"The Cult of St. Clare of Assisi in Early Modern Italy"""" focuses on the cult of St. Clare of Assisi in visual images and textual sources. This work examines the representations of St Clare in the Italian visual tradition from the thirteenth century on, but especially between the fifteenth and the mid-seventeenth centuries, in the context of mendicant activity. Through an examination of such diverse visual images as prints, drawings, panels, sculptures, minor arts, and frescoes in relation to sermons of Franciscan preachers, the book highlights the cult of women saints and its role in the reform movements of the Osservanza and the Catholic Reformation and in the face of Muslim-Christian encounter of the early modern era. This book appeared in Italian as """"L'iconografia di Santa Chiara d'Assisi.""

In her fourth book """"Crusade Propaganda in Word and Image in Early Modern Italy: Niccolò Guidalotto’s Panorama of Constantinople"""" she concentrated on a seventeenth-century panorama of Constantinople, which is an exceptional visual representation of the city. This panorama is viewed as an elaborate piece of anti- Ottoman propaganda designed by the Venetian Franciscan friar Niccolò Guidalotto da Mondavio.

Mariano N. Castañeda was a Philippine Constabulary and Philippine Army officer and a recipient the Philippines' highest military award for courage, the Medal of Valor. 

Castañeda graduated from the officer's school of the Philippine Constabulary on 15 November 1915, and from the Infantry School at Fort Benning, United States in 1940. He became President Manuel Quezon's aide-de-camp that same year and fought with the United States Army Forces in the Far East during the Battle of Bataan. He survived the Bataan Death March in 1942 and began organizing resistance against Imperial Japanese occupation, most notably the Fil-American Cavite Guerrilla Force shortly thereafter. In 1944, the Japanese-controlled Second Philippine Republic appointed him Governor of Cavite. After seven months in office, the Japanese became aware of his guerrilla affiliation and attempted to arrest him; he was able to elude his would-be captors.

Castañeda was appointed Provost Marshal General of the Philippine Army on 1 June 1946. He became Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines two years later.

The night before the Philippine Parity Rights plebiscite in 1947, President Manuel Roxas addressed a rally at Plaza Miranda. He narrowly avoided an assassination attempt by Julio Guillen, a disgruntled barber who threw a grenade on the speaker's platform. José Avelino, the Senate President, saw the bomb and gave it a kick. Castañeda then kicked it further down a set of steps as he covered the President with his own body. The grenade exploded near the audience, killing two people and injuring others. Guillen was arrested and executed via the electric chair on 26 April 1950. Castañeda was conferred the Medal of Valor as a consequence of his actions that night.

The deadly missile landed on the speaker’s platform and rolled towards the center of the late President Roxas and other ranking government officials. In spite of the inevitable explosion and its lethal results, General Castañeda, then Chief of the Constabulary, in complete disregard of his personal safety, rushed from his seat behind the President’s chair to the lethal weapon which was about to explode, and with extraordinary coolness and presence of mind ordered the people to lie down and then kicked the death-dealing grenade down the steps of the platform where it exploded. His presence of mind and display of exemplary courage and bravery in the timely disposal of the lethal grenade saved the life of the First President of the Philippines and those of his family and other higher ranking officials of the Republic, who at that moment, were all with him on the platform..""

"Alastair Hugh Graham

Alastair Hugh Graham (27 June 1904 - 1982) was an honorary attaché in Athens and Cairo, an Oxford friend of Evelyn Waugh and, according to Waugh's letters, one of his ""romances"". He is, together with Hugh Lygon, considered the main inspiration for Sebastian Flyte in ""Brideshead Revisited"".

Alastair Hugh Graham was born on 27 June 1904. His mother was a cotton heiress from Savannah, Georgia, Jessie Low, while his father, Hugh Graham (1860-1921), was a British landed aristocrat of the Graham baronets, the younger son of Sir Frederick Ulric Graham, of Netherby, 3d Baronet (1820–1888) and Lady Jane Hermione Seymour (1832–1909), daughter of Edward Seymour, 12th Duke of Somerset. Jessie Graham would later appear as Lady Circumference in ""Decline and Fall"" and as Mrs. Kent-Cumberland in ""Winner Takes All"" both by Evelyn Waugh.

Alastair Hugh Graham attended Wellington College, Wellington, Berkshire, and then went to Brasenose College, Oxford University, where he met Evelyn Waugh around Christmas 1923 or slightly before. Graham sent Waugh the photo of a naked man near a waterfall, asking Waugh to ""Come and drink with me somewhere"". Netherby Hall was the Grahams official residence, but Alastair Hugh Graham and his family lived in an early 19th century country house, Barford House, Barford, Warwickshire, between Warwick and Stratford-upon Avon, and it's here that he had as a guest Evelyn Waugh. Graham was Waugh's closest friend from 1924 to 1929. In ""Brideshead Revisited"", Evelyn Waugh makes Charles Ryder remembering ""I had been there before, first with Sebastian more than twenty years ago on a cloudless day in June..."". According to Philip Eade and others, here Waugh is remembering his own love affair with Alastair Graham, started at Graham's family home, Barford House, in 1923 when Graham was 19 years old. The same Waugh stated in his memories that Graham was the inspiration of Lord Sebastian Flyte even more than Hugh Lygon. Moreover sometime the name Alistair occurs in place of Sebastian in the manuscript of ""Brideshead Revisited"". In Waugh's autobiography, ""A Little Learning... an autobiography"" (1964), Graham appears under the name of Hamish Lennox, and Waugh said of him he was ""the friend of my heart"".

When Waugh left Oxford one term short of the degree requirements in August 1924, he went to live with Graham in a caravan in a field near Beckley and from there they went to Ireland for a vacation. It was after this travel that Graham converted to Roman Catholic Church. When Graham went to visit his sister and her husband in Kenya in mid-September 1924, the friendship between Graham and Waugh took a step back, but in August 1926, Graham, his mother and Waugh went to Scotland and upon their return, Graham and Waugh went to France together with Richard Plunket Greene. Around this time, Graham, who owned a small printing press and was then apprenticed at the Shakespeare Head Press, printed Waugh's essay ""P.R.B.: An Essay on the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood 1847-54"".

Alastair Hugh Graham was an honorary attaché in Athens, Greece, between 1927 and 1929, where Waugh visited him for the Christmas holidays. In Greece Graham lived with another attaché, Mark Ogilvie-Grant. In 1929 he was transferred in Cairo, Egypt, with Ogilvie-Grant and Vivian Cornelius, and remained until 1933.

From 1933 he lived as a recluse on the Welsh Coast, at Plas-Y-Wern Lodge, Gilfachrheda.

During World War II, Graham was attached to the US Navy.

Johan Pistorius (d. 1722), was a Danish grenadier. He was executed judged guilty of making a Satanic pact, and was the last person executed for witchcraft in Denmark. 

Johan Pistorius was a soldier in the danish army with the rank of grenadier. He was arrested and accused of the crime of making a pact with the Devil. He was not put on trial by the Danish authorities, but by a military court. He was judged guilty and sentenced to be executed by a military court martial. He confessed to the crime. He claimed to have been inspired to the pact after reading a book about Doctor Faust. 

The court faculty of Professors in Copenhagen recommended the king to confirm his sentence after they had interrogated him - which was unusual - and deemed that his regret was not sufficient, and that he should be executed as a public warning against the crime of Devil's Pact after having made a public confession of regret, which resulted in the public burning of the infamous pact at Nytorv square, followed by the execution of Pistorius the following day. 

While Anne Palles is often called the last witch to be executed in Denmark, she was in fact only the last woman to be executed for witchcraft in Denmark, as Johan Pistorius was executed circa thirty years after her. There where death sentences for witchcraft in Denmark long after this. In 1733 a student, and in 1752 a farmer, were sentenced to life imprisonment with forced labor for Satanic pact, and as late as in 1803, two craftsmen received death sentences for the same crime, although none of the sentences where actually carried out. People where also lynched for witchcraft in Denmark long after the formal persecution stopped: the most known cases being that of Dorte Jensdatter, who was apprehended by the villagers who tied her up in her own home and burned it down after having accused her of causing death by magic, and the last lynching of witchcraft, in which Anna Klemens was lynched after having being pointed out for sorcery by a cunning woman in Brigsted at Horsens in 1800.",Johan Pistorius,639

"Walter Peeters

Walter Peeters is a Belgian engineer, economist and professor. He became president of the International Space University in 2011.
Peeters was born in Antwerp on 28 June 1950. He completed primary school in Ekeren at the St.-Lambertusinstituut and afterwards at the Royal Atheneum in Antwerp. He obtained an engineering degree in nuclear engineering, a degree in Applied Economics at the Catholic University of Louvain, and an MBA with the thesis on 'Fleet Size Scheduling' (Catholic University of Leuven, Belgium, 1982). Later he obtained a doctorate in engineering at the Technical University of Delft with a doctoral thesis on: ‘The appropriate use of contract types in development contracts’ 

Peeters worked as engineer in the construction sector and in the petrochemical sector, specializing in the field of project planning. In 1983, he joined the European Space Agency (ESA) and was involved in several control and project management functions. Initial assignments were related to the extension of test facilities at ESA’s technology center ESTEC in Noordwijk before joining the Hermes project in Toulouse. After several redesign phases the mass of the Hermes spacecraft continued to increase as well as the estimated cost-to-completion; at the end the ESA Member States decided to terminate the project. Upon creation of the European Astronaut Center (EAC) in Cologne, he became Head of the astronaut coordination office and acted in Star City, by Moscow, as coordinator of the astronaut operations during the EUROMIR missions in 1994 and 1995. As far as academic activities are concerned, after a sabbatical year he published the book ‘Space Marketing’ in 2000 and joined the International Space University as Professor in space business and management. In 2004 he was named as dean of the university, which was highly noted in the Belgian press, and since 2011 elected as president. Research activities are focused on the commercialization of space activities as well as the development of New Space activities. Specific attention is dedicated to the transition from experimental sub-orbital space tourism to commercial spaceflights, leading to a publication for the International Academy of Astronautics on sub-orbital space tourism. In 2009 he was elected as Founding Director of the International Institute of Space Commerce (IISC). Special interests include the role of space activities as a catalyst of international cooperation, as presented inter alia at Facing Tomorrow in Jerusalem. It also led him to propose in 2014 the International Space Station as a candidate for the Peace Noble Prize; however, the geopolitical context (situation in Ukraine) at that time were not beneficial for this proposal. Recent emphases of Peeters includes consulting of governments such as the Baltic States (from 2011 onwards), Luxembourg (2017), South-Australia (2017) and Oman as well as assisting young space entrepreneurs in business plan development and start-up activities. He is working together closely with the local authorities to promote space activities in Alsace and to transfer part of ISU as a space incubator in the North of France. In 2017 he was also involved in discussions in Ireland on the possible establishment of an Irish Space Agency.",Walter Peeters,650

"Herrenhausen Palace

Herrenhausen Palace (German: ""Schloss Herrenhausen"") is a former royal residence in the Herrenhausen district of the German city of Hanover.

Originally a manor house of 1640, it was enlarged in phases from 1676, and served as a summer retreat, located only a few kilometers outside the city from the central Leineschloss. In 1683 Sophia of Hanover commissioned the French gardener Martin Charbonnier to enlarge the garden in the manner of Versailles to form the 50 hectare ""Grosser Garten"". Sophia's husband, Ernest Augustus, Elector of Brunswick-Luneburg, planned its replacement with a large baroque palace, and began construction with the ""Galerie"", but their son, elector George Louis, who in 1714 succeeded to the British throne as King George I, gave up the palace building project and concentrated on adding water features to the garden.

The next king, George II, planned again for a new palace in better proportion with the ""Grosser Garten"", but never realized it. His successor George III, who never visited Herrenhausen, had the palace modernised in neoclassical style by Georg Ludwig Friedrich Laves.

During World War II Herrenhausen Palace suffered immense damage in a British bombing raid on 18 October 1943 (although the Royal Air Force had been requested by the British Royal Family not to attack the palace, at the time still owned by the House of Hanover).

The ruins of the palace were almost completely torn down after the war; the outside staircase once leading up to the entrance was salvaged from the debris and moved next to the Orangerie building where it can be seen today. 

In 2009, it was decided to rebuild the palace and it was reopened on 18 January 2013 in a ceremony attended by Their Royal Highnesses, Princess Beatrice of York and Princess Eugenie of York, as well as by Prince Ernst August of Hanover whose private residence is the nearby ""Princely House"", a small palace built in 1720 by George I for his daughter Anna Louise.

The reconstructed baroque palace houses the Museum Schloss Herrenhausen and exhibition space sponsored by the Volkswagen Foundation.

The palace's extensive gardens extending beyond the original ""Grossen Garten"" are an important example of baroque and later garden design and contain many significant period garden buildings. The gardens were reinstated following damage in World War II, and became a major leisure resource for the city of Hanover, with new additions including an aquarium.

King George II of Great Britain was born in Herrenhausen Palace in 1683. Three of his daughters were born there:

Ernest Augustus, Elector of Brunswick-Lüneburg, George II's grandfather, died in Herrenhausen Palace in 1698.

After World War II the remains of King George I of Great Britain along with his parents' were removed from the chapel of Leineschloss and reinterred in the 19th-century ""Welfenmausoleum"" of King Ernest Augustus I in the ""Berggarten"" at Herrenhausen.",Herrenhausen Palace,666

It is believed that the then Energy and Power Development Minister of Zimbabwe Dr Samuel Undenge reportedly pressured the Zimbabwe Power Company to pay Chivayo’s company called Intratek Zimbabwe $5 million in the absence of a bank guarantee.

Chivayo single handedly sponsored the Zimbabwe national football team but later withdrew that sponsorship. Chivayo was part of an audience that attended a meeting in South Africa held by current Zimbabwean president Emmerson Mnangagwa.

President Emmerson Mnangagwa went to South Africa in December 2017, to address potential Zimbabwean investors based in that nation.
Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa had plans to investigate Wicknell Chivayo over $1 billion worth of tender business from the Zimbabwean government. Energy Sector Workers Union of Zimbabwe accused the Zimbabwe Electricity Transmission and Distribution Company (ZETDC) of providing funds to Wicknell Chivhayo and Zimbabwe's former first lady Grace Mugabe.

He (Chivayo), is believed to be associated with former Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe and his family. Chivayo, was also believed to be a supporter of the Generation 40 (G40) through his association with Grace Mugabe who is believed to have instructed him to apologise for saying that Jonathan Moyo was wrong for suggesting that the Zimbabwe Football Association required corporate sponsorship and not individual sponsorship. Additionally, Chivayo was believed to be a G40 financier.

In 2017 the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA) and the Zimbabwean Parliament probed Chivayo's electricity power contracts that included a USD$200 million dollar power contract for Gwanda, a small town in Zimbabwe and other power contracts that had an accumulated value in excess of USD$600 million of which none were ever delivered.

"The Sioux Chef's Indigenous Kitchen

The Sioux Chef's Indigenous Kitchen is a recipe book written by Sean Sherman with Beth Dooley, published by the University of MN Press in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Sean Sherman is an Oglala Lakota Chef who was born in Pine Ridge, South Dakota and is currently based in South Minneapolis. Sherman will be opening an indigenous cuisine restaurant within the Water Works park development project overlooking St. Anthony Falls and the Stone Arch Bridge in Minneapolis, due to open in 2019.

The cookbook advocates use of native american cuisine, indigenous ingredients and ancestral culinary techniques as a way to return to healthy collective eating habits and reduce the incidence of diabetes and other health issues which are endemic on Indian Reservations and among Native people.

Recipes are grouped by where the ingredients are obtained, including 'Fields and Gardens', 'Prairies and Lakes' and 'The Indigenous Pantry.' Informative sidebars cover topics ranging from the difference between terminology, to ingredient information, to the noble way to hunt. Commonly-held information such as the 'three sisters' ingredients of corn, beans and squash; and the unique, crucial aspects of hominy is enhanced with additional science/cooking/diet aspects based on Sherman's extensive research.

Sherman researched the foods and cooking methods extensively, using published sources as well as personal interviews with family members and others in his tribe in Pine Ridge, and principles of ethnobotany. The food-related disruptions of colonialism - including the additions of white flour, sugar, dairy and fat - are stripped away, replaced by food that utilizes regional ingredients to create an empowering diet.

While the health issues facing Native people are extensively researched solutions are less clear. Many groups have tackled the problems before with limited success, and for some the idea of returning to original eating habits is unrealistic. Nevertheless, the facts speaking to the misfit between government-issued foods and the genetic disposition of Native people is clear. The Sioux Chef joins a decades-long, growing movement including cookbooks such as ""Foods of the Americas: Native Recipes and Traditions"" written by husband/wife team Fernando Divina and Marlene Divina and published by Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian when it opened in 2004, and by Heid E. Erdrich in 2013, a 2006 Television Series called 'Seasoned With Spirit: A Native Cook’s Journey with Loretta Barrett Oden', organizations including Native Seeds/SEARCH and the International Institute of Indigenous Science-Indigenous Permaculture, health systems focused on Native populations, and various groups focusing on sustainable agriculture such as the USDA and the Land Stewardship Project.

""There are cookbooks from which one simply cooks the recipes, and cookbooks like Chef Sherman’s, from which one learns how and why to cook,"" Eric Patterson notes, in a positive review - stating that the recipes a means to the end of reclaiming the history and culture of indigenous peoples.

Sherman's book - part textbook, part cookbook - tells the story of growing up on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota. It also includes Sean's dismissal of fry bread as simply not good enough; given all that had been part of his people's diets before and all that is available now - and how people in other parts of the world had retained their original, healthy diets.",The Sioux Chef s Indigenous Kitchen,674

"Addis's Single Rail Tramway

The Addis's Single Rail Tramway was a patented monorail system invented in 1869 by William Judson Addis.

William Judson Addis from Thane (previously Tanna) in India invented, patented and developed a tramway with a single rail, on which a bullock cart ran with two double flanged wheels, which could take all, or nearly all, the weight, and two ordinary stabilising wheels, which served to prevent over-turning. A cart, loaded with three tons, could easily be drawn by two bullocks.

Addis was granted his first patent in 1869, and in 1870 a further patent was granted concerning improvements to the track system. The investment cost for sleepers and rails was less than 50 % of an ordinary narrow gauge railway.

The monorails were laid at the sides of an existing road, one for up traffic and the other for down troffic, leaving the centre part of the road for ordinary traffic. The rails protruded only 1½-2 inches (40-50 mm) above the surface of the road to limit the interferences with the ordinary road traffic. The cost of tramway was claimed ed to be Rs 4000-5000 per mile.

For demonstrating the advantages, Mr. Addis bas laid down a length of rail in the grounds of his ironworks at Thane, upon which he has placed two carts or wagons specially constructed by him for the tramway. A portion of the rail was laid at an incline of 1 in 40, and another portion, on level ground, described a 10 ft (3 m) radius curve. This experimental line has been visited by many government officials and others, who have seen with satisfaction the ease with which a pair of bullocks drew three tons along the tramway.

The flanged centre wheels were attached to a screw, by which the framework of the cart could be raised, so that on level ground the ordinnry side wheels were set to be 1-2 inch (25-50 mm) above the surface of the road, and the entire weight of the burden rested on the rail. The side wheels touched the ground only occasionally, but the main weight was borne by the centre wheels, resulting in very low friction. In some experiments, a large log of wood was placed on the ground, over which one of the side wheels would pass without derailing. When a small hole was dug in the line of a side wheel, this could also be passed without an accident.

A line was laid between Kalyan and Kalyan Bunder over a distance of 1¼ mile (2 km) to transport salt.

The Kamala Mills fire was a fire accident at the Kamala Mills Compound in Lower Parel area of Mumbai which resulted in the deaths of 14 people on 28 December 2017.

Initial reports suggested the fire broke out in a rooftop restobar, ""1Above"", and rapidly spread to next door pub ""Mojo's Bistro"", but a technical investigation report of the Mumbai Fire Brigade found the fire started at ""Mojo’s Bistro"" due to ‘flying embers’ from a hookah.

Mumbai Fire Brigade's deputy chief fire officer R. Chaudhary said both establishments did not have emergency exits, working fire safety equipment, and flammable material such as tarpaulin sheets and artificial flowers for decoration aggravated the fire.

The fire affected transmission of many television channels as several media companies had their broadcasting office in the compound.

Algernon Henry Barkworth (4 June 1864 – 29 April 1933) was a ""RMS Titanic"" passenger and survivor. It has been suggested that he was one of the LGBT passengers aboard the Titanic.

Algernon Henry Barkworth was born in Tranby House in Hessle, Sculcoates, Yorkshire, England on 4 June 1864, the son of Henry Barkworth (1822-1898) and Catherine Hester Smith (1838-1915). His father was a timber merchant, farmer and landowner. The family was wealthy and Algernon grew up surrounded by an entourage of servants and was raised by his governess Amelia Selina Coxhead (1844-1920).

In the 1900s for a short time Barkworth lived in Puddletrenthide, a village in Dorset, next door to his brother Edmund, who was a farmer and landowner. Around 1911 Barkworth went back living with his widowed mother and unmarried sister Evelyn at Tranby House. At the time he was a Justice of the Peace for the East Riding of Yorkshire, a position he had held since 1903.

Barkworth boarded the Titanic at Southampton as a first class passenger and he occupied cabin A23. This was Barkworth's first trip to the USA where he intended to spend a month. On the night of the sinking Barkworth stepped into the waters and made his way to the overturned collapsible B. Following the sinking, Barkworth spent time at the home of a Mrs Richard F. Wood in Concord, Massachusetts, but he soon returned to England.

Barkworth lived in Tranby House for the rest of his life and never married, his own relatives indicating that he was not of that persuasion. 

He was a member of the East Riding Bench for 33-years, elected one month after the Titanic's sinking, until just one year before his death and was at one point a member of the East Riding County Council.

A reported eccentric with a love of animals, he was also an avid collector of curios.

His mother died some months after the Titanic tragedy, and he continued to live with his sister Evelyn until her death in 1933. Barkworth, plagued with chronic respiratory problems, died on 7 January 1945. Alderman E. C. S. Stow said: ""He is a gentleman if ever there was one - a type which is fast dying out"".

He was buried with his sister Evelyn in Mill Lane Cemetery, Kirk Ella, Yorkshire.

The house was inherited and lived in by successive generations of Barkworths until his great-grandnephew, Algernon Henry Barkworth. After Algernon Barkworth's death in 1945, the house was bequeathed to the local education authority to become a school, which it did in 1947 as Tranby High School. In 1967, Tranby House became a Grade II listed building to ensure its history and architecture are protected.",Algernon Henry Barkworth,704

New Wolfstein Castle () is a ruined hill castle at on a 238-metre-high hill above the town of Wolfstein in the county of Kusel in the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate. Today the ruins are a cultural monument

Not much is known about the origins of the castle. It was probably built by Rudolph of Habsburg between 1275 and 1324 in connexion with the founding of the town of Wolfstein, as part of the town's defences. It is first recorded in 1324 as ""Hus zu Wolvenstein"".

In 1503, during the War of the Succession of Landshut, the castle was badly damaged. In 1609 it was demolished and rebuilt. In 1688 it was destroyed by the French and rebuilt yet again in order to serve as a barracks for French soldiers. This was in turn partly destroyed by cannon fire in 1713 on the orders of Marshal Villar and the Kingdom of Bavaria then used the ruins as a quarry. From 1720 to 1771, St. George's Chapel at the castle was used by the borough of Wolfstein as a church. In 1792 the site was recorded as being in a poor state. Two years later French soldiers used the castle as a chapel and medical post. Until 1798 the building was still used as a vicarage. After that the castle was left to fall into ruins.

The ruins are used today as a war memorial. Since 1963, they have belonged to the state of Rhineland-Palatinate.

Of the old castle, the remains of the neck ditch, the 1.2-metre-thick enceinte, the shield wall, the castle gate and the foundations of the ""palas"" have survived.

Ontario and San Antonio Heights Railroad Company operated Ontario’s unique Gravity Mule Car from 1887 to 1895.

The uphill trip up Euclid Avenue took 90 minutes, but the downhill ride lasted only 30 minutes, because a pull-out trailer allowed the mules to ride as passengers. The mule-car served Ontario until 1895, when an electric streetcar replaced it. It was occasionally used afterwards, when the electrical generator in the powerhouse was flooded.

The obituary for the mule Sanky on the front page of the Ontario Daily Report of 6 February 1914 was under the headline, “Mule, Figure in Early History of Ontario, is Dead.” It mentioned that in 1895, Sanky and his partner Moody were sold to farmer C.B. Adams in San Antonio Heights after the inauguration of the electric tram had made them obsolete. Ranch work was apparently far below their dignity and when hitched to a harrow, they persistently refused to budge, and coaxing and force were equally without effect. The farmer had to motivate them by attaching a bell from the old rail car to his harrow. With the familiar signal, the mules started valiantly up the orchard, but at the head of the orchard, Moody and Sanky persisted in attempting to climb onto the harrow for the downward journey, said the obituary. It took weeks before the pair could be trained to plow in both directions.",Ontario and San Antonio Heights Railroad Company,714

"St Elisabeth's Eastbourne

St Elisabeth’s church is a Grade II listed building in Eastbourne, Sussex, England.

The church was built in 1935-1938 to the designs of local architects Stonham & Sons and Fenning. The church is a good example of the architecture of the period and contains notable artworks. It is one of several sites across Sussex to benefit from the encouragement given to the arts by a previous Bishop of Chichester, George Bell (1883-1958). 

The artworks at St Elisabeth's include chancel paintings by the art historian and conservator, Ernest William Tristram (1882-1952). Created in 1938, the Tristram Panels depict the life of John the Baptist and his parents, the priest Zacharias and his wife Elizabeth. Tristram is known for cataloguing and making watercolour paintings of existing church frescoes. However, Tristram also painted a limited number of original works, including the panels at St Elisabeth's and paintings at York Minster and St Fin Barre's Cathedral in Cork City. 

In addition, St Elisabeth's crypt contains a series of large wall paintings by the artist Hans Feibusch (1898-1998).  Feibusch was a Jewish refugee who fled Germany for Britain in the 1930s. His work was included in the Nazi-organised Degenerate Art Exhibition of 1937.  In Britain, Feibusch became a member of the London Group and found his niche fulfilling commissions to paint murals in churches and other public buildings.  Through this work he came to the attention of Charles Herbert Reilly, professor of architecture, and George Bell who provided Feinbusch with the opportunity to create a mural of his own design at St Elisabeth’s in 1944.  Feibusch chose the allegory of Pilgrim's Progress as a vehicle for his own story as a refugee fleeing Nazi Germany and his eventual acceptance in 1940s Britain. Feibusch enlisted the help of local people to complete the mural, which is now a registered War Memorial dedicated to civilian casualties of war.

Structural flaws in St Elisabeth's church became apparent in 1943 and a bomb caused further damage during WWII. The building's deteriorating condition and the cost of repairs led to the church closing for worship in 2002, with the congregation continuing to meet in the church hall. The Church of England owns the building and in 2017/18 consulted on proposals to demolish the church and to move the Feibusch murals.",St Elisabeth s Eastbourne,725

"Schloss Kirchheimbolanden

Schloss Kirchheimbolanden is located in the town of Kirchheimbolanden in the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate. As a castle the site was first mentioned in a document as early as 1390.

From 1602 to 1618, a castle (the so-called ""old castle"" or ""Alte Schloss"") was built outside the actual town walls by the counts of Nassau-Weilburg, who had their permanent residence at Weilburg on the Lahn.

A new building was erected between 1738 and 1740 under Prince Charles Augustus of Nassau-Weilburg. Charles Augustus was an imperial prince and wanted a modern building. Guillaume d'Hauberat was engaged as architect and master builder; he also built Mannheim and Schwetzingen Palaces for the Elector of the Palatinate. A ""schlossgarten"" was to be laid out in a terraced design at the new ""schloss"", the irrigation of which was to be taken from the copper pits of the nearby village of Haide. Some of these water channels have survived to this day.

After the occupation of nearby Mainz by the French, Prince Frederick William of Nassau-Weilburg fled in 1793 from Kirchheimbolanden to Bayreuth. This ended the castle's function as a princely residence, and thus also the reign of the princes of Nassau-Weilburg over this region.

In 1807, the castle and gardens were declared as French national property and could thus be sold. The site was auctioned in Mainz in 1807, as Mainz was now the administrative seat of the Department of Mont-Tonnerre. It was purchased by landowner and textile manufacturer, Daniel Andreas, from Mülheim an der Ruhr. He had the central structure and the left wing of the palace demolished and moved his private apartment into the remaining right wing of the palace.

After the end of French rule, Mont-Tonnerre fell to the Kingdom of Bavaria in 1816. The region was initially referred to as the Circle of the Rhine (""Rheinkreis"") and, later, as Rhenish Palatinate (""Rheinpfalz"").

On 21 March 1839, Schloss Kirchheimbolanden was sold to Bavarian master builder, Leo von Klenze from Munich. He had extensive structural changes made, but did not take up permanent residence at the castle. In 1841, he sold the property to pensioner, Heinrich Seligmann from Mainz, who, in 1844, sold it to farmer, Friedrich Brunck, from nearby Winterborn/Alsenz.

In 1848/49, the Palatinate ""Freischärler"" declared the castle to be their headquarters, but they were soon driven out by Prussian troops.

On 3 November 1861, the east wing of the castle burnt down. Friedrich Brunck had it rebuilt in a simplified form with two floors and a hipped roof.

In 2003, the old U-shape of the castle was rebuilt as Schloss Kirchheimbolanden Old People's Home (""Seniorenresidenz Schloss Kirchheimbolanden""), only the east wing being structurally reminiscent of its former form and splendour. But in this way the general shape of the old castle has been recreated as a three-winged complex.

Frankfurt garden designer, Heinrich Siesmayer, was commissioned by Dr. Heinrich Ritter von Brunck to design the palace garden. Siesmayer had been commissioned by the grandson (Duke Adolph of Nassau) of the last prince residing in Kirchheimbolanden, who then fled, with the sale of his extensive collection of plants and trees from Schloss Biebrich near Wiesbaden, because the Prussians annexed his Duchy of Nassau in 1866.",Schloss Kirchheimbolanden,728

Bertram Benedict was born circa 1892 in Baltimore, Maryland. He graduated from Johns Hopkins University in 1912.

Benedict began his career as a social worker in Pittsburgh and Syracuse. In 1917, he was hired by the Bureau of National Literature, and authored several books, including ""The Larger Socialism"", published in 1921. In the book, Benedict, who was a member of the Socialist Party of America, considers whether socialism is more Christian than capitalism, and criticizes the over-reliance of Marxian theory, especially its focus on social classes, in the American context. Benedict contended that socialism failed to appear attractive to most Americans because most socialists were born outside the United States and failed to adapt its tenets to the reality of rural America, whose economy was primarily agricultural, not industrial. He added that most Americans were ""unable or unwilling to think in abstract terms""; instead, he believed Americans would need a charismatic socialist leader to find it attractive. In the ""American Journal of Sociology"", Victor E. Helleberg wrote that the book was ""an attempt to reconstruct the strategy of socialist campaigning by broadening the outlook and considering carefully the situation in the United States."" Reviewing it for the ""Journal of Political Economy"", Paul Douglas called it ""an extraordinary clear and candid book.""

Benedict first worked for the Editorial Research Reports in 1929. He acquired a stake in 1944, and left the company in 1959. He reviewed books for ""The New York Times Magazine"".

Frederick Woltman (1905–1970) was a 20th-century American newspaper journalist for the ""New York World-Telegram"", known as ""an anti-communist reporter in the 1940s and early 1950s but best known for criticism of U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy in a series of articles called ""The McCarthy Balance Sheet,"" which ran July 12-16, 1954.

Enos Frederick Woltman was born on March 16, 1905.

Until 1929, Woltman taught Philosophy at the University of Pittsburgh, when the Pennsylvania Governor Gifford Pinchot had him fired for an article he had written in the ""American Mercury"" about police brutality during a coal strike. Roy Howard of the ""New York World-Telegram"" hired him because of it.

After World War Two, Woltman received assistance from Victor Laskyon articles about Communist Party infiltration within the USA.

In 1946, Woltman beat out other newspaper investigators into the accusation of Louis F. Budenz that a high-level communist spy was working in the United States and discovered that person was Gerhart Eisler.
Frederick Woltman, a reporter with a long-standing reputation as a staunch anti-communist, wrote a five-part series of articles criticizing McCarthy in the ""New York World-Telegram."" He stated that McCarthy ""has become a major liability to the cause of anti-communism"", and accused him of ""wild twisting of facts and near facts [that] repels authorities in the field"". 

""TIME"" magazine described Woltman as follows: Long acknowledged the No. 1 newspaper specialist on Reds, he has been exposing Communists since 1938, and, unlike many other anti-Communist writers, he was never a Communist himself. A hard-digging reporter, he backed his stories with solid documentation—e.g., he exposed Gerhart Eisler as the top Kremlin agent in the U.S. the day before the FBI picked Eisler up... This week the World-Telly and other Scripps-Howard papers splashed Woltman's five-part series across their pages. His appraisal: McCarthy is ""a major liability to the cause of anti-Communism."" By making it harder for real Communist-fighters to operate effectively, wrote Woltman, McCarthy has actually become an asset to Communism. ""He has introduced a slambang, rabble-rousing, hit-and-run technique into the serious business of exposing the Communist conspiracy... and thereby disarranged... The story was so controversial that it stirred up coverage itself, including again by ""TIME"": ""In their series on Joe McCarthy, the Scripps-Howard papers... stirred up an even bigger furor than they had expected""",Frederick Woltman,767

Katherine Langhorne Adams (1885–1977) was an American painter and printmaker. Other sources give her birthdate as c. 1882 and 1890.

Born in Plainfield, New Jersey, Adams studied at the Art Students League of New York, where her instructors included John Henry Twachtman and Frank Vincent DuMond. She is known to have exhibited work with artists from the Cos Cob colony in 1912 and 1913, but little else is known about her time in Old Lyme, Connecticut, save for an incident when her bedroom in the Griswold House was mistakenly entered one night by a misdirected male artist. She traveled extensively in her youth, visiting many parts of Europe and Japan; in the 1930s she lived in Buenos Aires. Somewhere around 1916 she married Benjamin Pettengill Adams, with whom she moved to New York; she thereafter began exhibiting work under her married name. During the 1920s her work appeared in shows at three New York galleries. By the later 1920s, she and her husband had moved to Sneden's Landing in New York's Palisades. There she designed their house, which won first prize in a ""House Beautiful"" contest for ""the best small house East of the Mississippi. She later moved to Washington, D.C.. During her career she exhibited work at the Art Institute of Chicago, the Cleveland Museum of Art, the Albright Art Gallery, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and the Corcoran Gallery of Art; her art appeared in exhibits at the National Academy of Design, the Society of Independent Artists, and the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors, receiving the Marcia Tucker Prize from the last-named organization in 1935 and an honorable mention in 1936. Two of her paintings were submitted to the Panama-Pacific International Exposition in 1915. Adams also lived for a time in Fairfield, Connecticut. She died in Alexandria, Virginia.

As a painter, Adams favored landscape subjects, which she tended to depict in a more abstract fashion described as reminiscent of her teacher Twachtman. Her 1934 oil on canvas ""Man and Beast"" is currently in the collection of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. She has been posited at the subject of a 1906 painting by Childe Hassam, ""The Victorian Chair"".",Katherine Langhorne Adams,770

"Hutchinsoniella

Hutchinsoniella macracantha is a species of Crustacean known as a horseshoe shrimp. It is the only species in the genus Hutchinsoniella and was first described in 1955 by Howard L. Sanders, having been discovered in Long Island Sound; they were the first example of a new class of crustacean that was given the name Cephalocarida.

Adult cephalocaridans are between in length. The body is divided into a cephalon, a segmented thorax and a segmented abdomen, with a cephalic shield covering the cephalon. There are no eyes and the body is flexible and translucent. The thorax has a pair of limbs on each segment while the abdomen is limbless, apart from the telson with its slender caudal filaments. The body and limbs are ornamented with various setae and spines. 

""Hutchinsoniella macracantha"" feeds on flocculent detritus, organic particles which have settled on the seabed in hollows and other places with little water movement. These particles are wafted by means of the thoracic limbs into a ventral groove which leads to the mouth.

Development is direct in this species, there being at least eighteen instar stages, but no pelagic stage, so dispersal is limited. After each moult in the early stages, two additional body segments are added. Initially the larva has two pairs of antennae and a pair of mandibles with palps. The palps are lost by instar 10, and the maxillae and thoracic limbs have developed over a number of moults by this stage, while the second antennae and mandible gradually become rudimentary. When the larva has gained a full complement of limbs it can be considered to be adult. In Long Island Sound, breeding takes place from June to the end of September, during which time three broods, each of two embryos is produced.",Hutchinsoniella,774

Hohenfels Castle () is a ruined hill castle at a height of , in the ""Beutelfels"" Nature Reserve north of the village of Imsbach in the county of Donnersbergkreis in the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate.
The castle may be reached via a steep footpath from the visitor mine of ""Weiße Grube"" in the valley of ""Langental"". The path passes the ""Iron Man"" monument ("""").

There are several clues that the road called in the records the Old Rockenhausen Road (""alte Rockenhauser Straße""), which ran from the area of Hahnweilerhof, continued past Hohenfels Castle in the direction of Falkenstein and Rockenhausen to Bad Kreuznach, had existed since Roman times. In 1820 a Roman hoard of 28 coins was found, which were dated to about the year 340 AD. Because there is also evidence of Roman mining activity in the deeply incised Langental valley, it is highly probable that there was a Roman fortification or road station in the area around Hohenfels Castle, as was common in the Late Roman period.

The assertion that, in 1128, Werner of Bolanden and his wife Guda of Hohenfels were named, and that Guda was the last member of an old Hohenfels dynasty cannot be proved by documentary evidence. It is true that, in that year and for the first time, a certain Werner of Bolanden appears in the light of history by being mentioned in a document, but his wife's name is not known. The fact is, however, that in the Bohland Fief Books (""Bohlander Lehensbüchern"") of the 12th century, the brothers Werner and Philip of Bolanden are mentioned as being enfeoffed with a castle, which the former Abbot of Prüm, Caesarius of Milendonk, described in 1222 in the Prüm Urbar in Latin as: ""bonum castrum quod Hoviles appelatur"" (the mining district of Imsbach had belonged since the 9th century to Prüm Abbey in the Eifel mountains). It is also the case that, in the first decades of the 13th century, the Bolanden family was divided into the lines of ""Bolanden"", ""Falkenstein"" and ""Hohenfels"". After that, Philip III of Bolanden-Hohenfels was owner of the castle until 1277; he was the imperial chamberlain or ""Reichskämmerer"" and ""Procurator on the Middle Rhine"". His sons Philip III ""jun."" called ""von Isenburg and Dietrich of Hohenfels shared the castle as co-heirs until 1290. The owners that followed, the brothers Hermann II ""the Elder"" and Werner of Hohenfels, lay 1333, along with others, feuded with the Imperial City of Speyer.

According to a document dated 11 July 1287, Templer Province Master Wildgrave Frederick, as well as Commander of the Templar House of Kirchheim an der Weinstraße, Henry of Hohenfels, together with his fellow knights templar, sold the parts of their estate i nthe parish of Laumersheim to the collegiate church of St. Martin in Worms.",Hohenfels Castle  Palatinate ,808

"Harold Gosney

Harold Gosney is an artist and sculptor. Many of Gosney's commissioned works are in the public domain; notably at York Art Gallery and on permanent display in Ripon, York and
Chester cathedrals.

Gosney became a student at Grimsby School of Art in 1954. He completed their Foundation course with such success that, two years later, he was offered a place at the prestigious Slade School of Fine Art.
He won several prizes whilst studying at the Slade, eventually specialising in theatre design.

In 1960, Gosney returned to teach at the Grimsby School of Art. He became deeply interested in sculpture from this point onwards.

Gosney has worked in wood and copper with favourite themes being birds, horses and the female form.
He developed a unique technique for working with sheet metal in three dimensions, exemplified by the life-size ""Horse and Rider"", now permanently on display at Normanby Hall in North Lincolnshire.
The majority of Gosney's early commissions were collaborations with architects and he has made a significant contribution to public art in Grimsby.
He is the artist responsible for the reliefs on the Abbey Walk car park,
the large Grimsby seal by the entrance to the Grimsby Central Library
and the Grim and Havelok themed copper relief on the side of Wilko store in Old Market Place.

Gosney retired from teaching in 1992 and moved to York to concentrate on sculpture.

As a rule, Gosney does not sell his work, but to celebrate his 80th birthday and retrospective exhibition, he offered two lots for auction, with all proceeds being donated to the Stained Glass Trust in York.

Gosney's work is often inspired by classical and Renaissance art and themes drawn from ancient and modern mythologies.
The human form and the horse dominate his subject matter and can be seen in many of his intriguing and remarkable sculptures and the beautifully
executed drawings which he makes when first planning commissions.

The artist has explained how his approach has changed over the years: ""My first sculptures in the early 60's were in stone and were
considerably inspired by the work of Henry Moore. When I experimented, first with cold cast metal and later with welding in steel and
copper, I carried out a number of abstract pieces. However, I soon needed a different challenge and returned to work that was derived from
observation and drawing, mostly inspired by human and animal forms. My work, whilst not overtly realistic, aims to consider the essence of

The Wakara were an indigenous Australian people of the state of Queensland.

The Wakara are estimated by Norman Tindale to have had a tribal domain of some 3., running along the southern flank of the upper Mitchell River, and extending eastwards as far as Mount Mulligan. To the west their frontiers lay around Wrotham Park and Blackdown.

White contact with the Wakara began in 1875, when settlers remarked that they were a powerful tribe in the region. They also noted the presence of another group, west of Mount Mulligan, called the ""Wunjurika,"" which may have been an autonomous tribe or simply a Band societyhorde of the Wakara. Within 15 years, by 1890, the Wunjurika had been so thorougholy absorbed into the Wakara tribe that they lost whatever independent identity they may have had. Though numerous at the initial stage of contact, the Goldfields Commissioner on the Hodgkinson diggings, H. M. Mowbray, wrote that within the decade, they had been 'much
reduced by its frequent encounters with the Native Police and the settlers, as well as by diseases introduced by the Whites.' Syphilis, also spread by contact with whites, further ravaged the tribe.

Mowbray reports that the Wakara had a distinctive custom compared to other tribes of his acquaintance, and that they practiced cannibalism on their own children, who were summarily killed for the most nugatory infractions of tribal law, and whom at times they cooked by roasting.",Wakara people,824

"Deep Image Prior

Deep Image Prior is a type of convolutional neural network used to enhance a given image with no prior training data other than the image itself.
A neural-network is randomly initialized and used as prior to solve inverse problems such as noise reduction, super-resolution, and inpainting. Image statistics is captured by the structure of a convolutional image generator rather than by any previously learned capabilities.

Inverse problems such as noise reduction, super-resolution, and inpainting can be formulated as the optimization task formula_1, where formula_2 is an image, formula_3 a corrupted representation of that image, formula_4 is a task-dependent data term, and R(x) is the regularizer. This forms an energy minimization problem.

Deep neural networks learn a generator/decoder formula_5 which maps a random code vector formula_6 to an image formula_2.

The image corruption method used to generate formula_3 is selected for the specific application.

In this approach, the formula_9 prior is replaced with the implicit prior captured by the neural network (where formula_10 for images that can be produced by a deep neural networks and formula_11 otherwise). This yields the equation for the minimizer formula_12 and the result of the optimization process formula_13.

The minimizer formula_14 (typically a gradient descent) starts from a randomly initialized parameters and descends into a local best result to yield the formula_15 restoration function.

A parameter θ may be used to recover any image, including its noise. However, the network is reluctant to pick up noise because it contains high impedance while useful signal offers low impedance. This results in the θ parameter approaching a good-looking local optimum so long as the number of iterations in the optimization process remains low enough not to overfit data.

The principle of denoising is to recover an image formula_2 from a noisy observation formula_3, where formula_18. The distribution formula_19 is sometimes known (eg: profiling sensor and photon noise) and may optionally be incorporated into the model, though this process works well in blind denoising.

The quadratic energy function formula_20 is used as the data term, plugging it into the equation for formula_14 yields the optimization problem formula_22.

Super-resolution is used to generate a higher resolution version of image x. The data term is set to formula_23 where d(·) is a downsampling operator such as Lanczos that decimates the image by a factor t.

Inpainting is used to reconstruct a missing area in an image formula_3. These missing pixels are defined as the binary mask formula_25. The data term is defined as formula_26 (where formula_27 is the Hadamard product).

This approach may be extended to multiple images. A straightforward example mentioned by the author is the reconstruction of an image to obtain natural light and clarity from a flash-no-flash pair. Video reconstruction is possible but it requires optimizations to take into account the spatial differences.",Deep Image Prior,838

"Søndeled (village)

Søndeled is a village in Risør municipality in Aust-Agder county, Norway. The village is located at the western end of the Søndeledfjorden at the mouth of the river Brøbøvann. The villages of Fiane and Eikeland (in Gjerstad) lie about to the north, the village of Akland lies about to the south, and the town of Risør is about to the southeast. 

Historically, the village was the administrative centre of the old municipality of Søndeled which existed from 1838 until its dissolution in 1964. People from this area are called ""søndølingar"". The Norwegian County Road 418 runs through the village, connecting to the European route E18 highway a short distance to the southwest. The village has a school, shops, and Søndeled Church.

The village (and municipality) is named after the fjord that it sits along (Old Norse: ""Sundaleiðr"", now called the Søndeledfjorden). The first element comes from the word ""sundene"" which means ""straits"" and the last element is ""led"" (Old Norse: ""leið"") which means ""path"" or ""way"".

Peter Joseph Tevenan (1857 – 11 April 1943) was an Irish trade unionist and politician.

Born in County Galway, Tevenan moved with his family to Liverpool when he was a young child. He worked first making pottery, then spent time as a miner, before finding work on the railways. Initially, he was a plate-layer, before becoming a signalman, and finally a station-master.

A supporter of trade unionism, Tevenan became active in the Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants, and served on its executive committee from 1891 to 1893. He was prominent in two strikes in Kingston-upon-Hull, one in 1890 among goodsworkers, and one in 1892 involving dockers. He became secretary of the union's operations in Ireland, and in 1896 convinced the Irish Trades Union Congress (ITUC) to convene a committee, chaired by himself, to consider whether a national federation of trade unions could be established. In 1900 and 1901, Tevenan served as treasurer of the ITUC.

After spending a period as an insurance agent and running to become an elected auditor in Stockport, in 1905 he found work as joint organiser of the Municipal Employees' Association (MEA), later becoming the union's North East District Secretary.

In 1906, Tevenan fell out with the MEA's general secretary, Albin Taylor, who dismissed him. Tevenan felt that Taylor's action was unwarranted, and was able to convince a majority of the MEA's members of this. They voted to suspend Taylor and reinstate Tevenan. Taylor responded by resigning and setting up the rival National Union of Corporation Workers, while Tevenan was reinstated.

In 1913, Tevenan was elected as general secretary of the MEA. Membership grew rapidly under his leadership, reaching a peak of 70,000. He was also active in the Public Services International, serving as its president for twelve years. He supported the merger of unions representing municipal workers; he took a leading role in the negotiations which formed the National Union of General and Municipal Workers in 1924. The MEA merged into the new union, and Tevenan served as one of its first two joint assistant general secretaries, and head of its municipal department.

Tevenan was active in the Labour Party. At the 1918 UK general election, he stood as its candidate in Liverpool Edge Hill, taking second place with 36.2% of the vote. In 1924/25, he served on the party's National Executive Committee.

Figures of amaranth and honey were made as offerings to the gods. In order to stop those religious practices, Hernán Cortés banned the cultivation of amaranth. The plant began to fall into disuse because those who continued to cultivate it faced being put to death as punishment.

She was also inducted into the Texas Woman's Hall of Fame.

Altshuler grew up in a mansion with her two brothers and parents in Dallas. Her father, Carr Collins Sr., had founded the Fidelity Union Life Insurance Company in the 1920s. Altshuler graduated from Woodrow Wilson High School in Dallas, and spent her summers at an exclusive girls' camp in Texas Hill Country. One of her brothers, James M. Collins, would become a member of the United States Congress. She attended Southern Methodist University where she met her husband, a naval aviator, when she was a junior. They were married, but her first husband died in combat during World War II. 

Altshuler started working at Dallas Love Field and met her second husband, Charles S. Sharp, whom she married in 1947. While pregnant with the first of her three children, she looked into joining the Junior League. She started working in the Junior League the next year. In the Junior League, she saw people who were in need and she began to volunteer. Altshuler was inspired to do philanthropy because of her parents and also because of the ideas of Albert Schweitzer. 

In 1960, she was appointed to head the woman's division of the 1960 Dallas County Community Chest Campaign. In 1974, she was the first woman to lead the Millionaires Chorus for the Salvation Army Christmas show.

When her brother, Collins, ran for a Senate seat in 1982, she helped him with his campaign. She traveled across Texas to promote her brother's candidacy. She didn't like to talk about politics, and instead focused on the kind of person her brother was. Charles Sharp eventually was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and died in 1984. Altshuler remarried to a physician, Ken Altshuler.

Case was born in London on April 25, 1932 to a father who made tombstones during the Great Depression. As a child he enjoyed mimicking actors and he was later awarded a singing scholarship to St Edward's School, Oxford. After graduating he enrolled at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art to be an actor. He worked with a repertory company in northern England, and made about 13 TV appearances between 1959 and 1964, including as ""Bob"" on the BBC show ""Maigret"" (1962) for one episode, but his acting career was not overly successful playing minor and occasional roles.

In 1976, he moved to San Francisco with his companion, Graham Watts. They had a business in Oakland importing antiques. In his spare time, he directed community theater productions, including one show that included British-born actress Wanda McCaddon who became friendly with Case. McCaddon, who was working at Books on Tape at the time, introduced him to the world of audiobook narration, an industry which was coming into maturity during the 1980s. ""When he found out I was doing books on tape, he said, 'That sounds like something I'd like to do'"", McCaddon remembered. 

Sigrid Hecht, co-founder of Books on Tape, was initially skeptical of his breathy interpretations. However he would excel at British works, recording 13 novels by Anthony Trollope, 36 by P. G. Wodehouse and the entire ""Forsyte"" chronicles by John Galsworthy. He worked as a freelance artist mostly for Books on Tape and Blackstone Audio during the 1980s and 1990s. Depending on the publisher, he recorded as David Case (Books on Tape), Frederick Davidson (Blackstone), Edward Raleigh, James Nelson, and Ian McKay. 

Case was a popular narrator, ""Readers said, 'Give me anything by Frederick Davidson,'"" recalled Lysa Williams of Blackstone Audio. ""AudioFile"" editor and founder, Robin Whitten, said Case recorded three times as many books as most other performers. Some listeners found his style off-putting, ""the most frequent criticism is that he sounds snooty and that his Continental accents all sound the same — sort of Austro-Hungarian"", observed Katherine Powers. But he had fans, the ""Washington Post"" obituary by Adam Bernstein said ""The English-born, classically trained Mr. Case was among the finest"". He was nominated for a Grammy Award and received numerous AudioFile Earphones Awards.

Case, a lifelong smoker, developed throat cancer in 2000 but kept recording, though his output slowed. He refused to stop smoking and doctors were forced to remove is larynx in May 2005, after which he lost his voice entirely. He died at his home in El Sobrante, California on October 1, 2005, unable to utter a sound. Case once said, ""I really believe I was born to record audiobooks.""",David Frederick Case,878

In early 1972, shortly after the release of the band's self-titled debut album, Luttrell left REO Speedwagon following a disagreement with Richrath. The vocalist was replaced by Kevin Cronin, who performed on the group's second album ""R.E.O./T.W.O."" before leaving during sessions for the 1973 follow-up. Mike Murphy took over and recorded ""Ridin' the Storm Out"", ""Lost in a Dream"" and ""This Time We Mean It"", but was replaced by a returning Cronin in 1976.

Hugh Osborn is a British theoretical high-energy physicist and a professor emeritus at the University of Cambridge, Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics.
He is famous for his work on Conformal Field Theory and Quantum Field Theory.

Osborn obtained his PhD in 1967 from the University College London. His PhD advisor was Sigurd Zienau. After postdoctoral positions at the University of Sussex and Queen Mary University of London, he became a professor first at the University of Glasgow and then in 1971 moved to the University of Cambridge where he remained ever since. He is a fellow of Trinity College.

In 1989, Osborn has obtained the first proof of the four-dimensional C-theorem, which was conjectured one year earlier by John Cardy. Osborn's proof was applicable to renormalization group flows which are perturbative, that is do not deviate far from the free quantum field theories, and was valid to all orders in perturbation theory. It provided a strong hint that the four-dimensional C-theorem must be universally valid, but a nonperturbative proof of this fact was found only in 2011 by Zohar Komargodski and Adam Schwimmer.

In 2001 and 2004, Osborn, in collaboration with Francis Dolan, obtained explicit expressions for the conformal blocks in four dimensional conformal field theories. Starting from 2008, these results found many important applications within the conformal bootstrap approach to conformal field theories.",Hugh Osborn,885

"Prasophyllum taphanyx

Prasophyllum taphanyx, commonly known as the graveside leek orchid, is a species of orchid endemic to a small area of Tasmania. It has a single tubular, green leaf and up to twenty five small, light green, pinkish-cream and purplish flowers. It rarely flowers and the largest number of flowers seen in any one year was three in 2001.

""Prasophyllum taphanyx"" is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single tube-shaped leaf which is long and wide. Between fifteen and twenty five light green, pinkish-cream and purplish flowers are crowded along a flowering spike which is long reaching to a height of . The flowers are long and wide and as with other leek orchids, are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is about long and wide. The lateral sepals are about long and wide and free from each other. The petals are about long, wide and spread widely apart from each other. The labellum is pinkish to purplish, about long and wide, and turns sharply upwards through about 90° near its middle. There is a broad, shiny green callus in the centre of the labellum and extending almost to its tip. Flowering occurs in October and November.

""Prasophyllum taphanyx"" was first formally described in 2004 by David Jones from a specimen collected in a cemetery in Campbell Town and the description was published in ""The Orchadian"". The specific epithet (""taphanyx"") is derived from the Ancient Greek words ""taphos"" meaning ""grave"" or ""tomb"" and ""antyx"" meaning ""edge"" or ""rim"", reflecting where the species is found and its ""perilous predicament"".

The graveside leek orchid is only known from three plants in remnant native grassland.

This orchid is classed as ""Endangered"" under the Tasmanian ""Threatened Species Protection Act 1995"" and as ""Critically Endangered"" under the Commonwealth Government ""Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999"" (EPBC) Act. The main threats to the species are its critically small population, land clearing and pasture improvement, inappropriate weed control and grazing, mowing or fire during the flowering period.",Prasophyllum taphanyx,891

"Make a Skyf, Man!

Make a Skyf, Man! is a work of autobiographical fiction by the anti-apartheid activist Harold Strachan. It was published in 2004.

The book depicts Jock Lundie, a fictionalised version of Strachan, and his involvement in the resistance movement against apartheid, starting with the Congress of Democrats then being a bomb-maker for Umkhonto we Sizwe. He describes his involvement as a ""boys' own armed struggle""; one passage depicts a successful demonstration of a home-made bomb to a senior comrade (Yoshke, based on Joe Slovo) by blowing up a beach toilet: Lundie gets arrested and serves three years in prison. He passes the time in solitary constructing a Tiger Moth in his imagination then preparing an aerobatics routine for it. Books are difficult to get and their pages are highly prized for making cigarettes or cannabis joints. As a result many books have pages missing. A former comrade, Themba Max, is executed.

Near the end of the book, Lundie is released after being found not guilty in a further trial thanks to the benevolent perjury of his neighbour who gives him an alibi. He moves back in with his wife Jess, gets to know his three-year-old daughter, and ejects his wife's boyfriend from the family home.

The book begins and ends with stories about angling for shad, a longstanding passion of Strachan's.

The book is loosely chronological but there are many diversions into South African history. It is written in South African English, with extensive use of Afrikaans phrases. The book is autobiographical fiction and was based on anecdotes he told. He has described how he tries to use the techniques of painting, such as contrast of texture, in his writing, and has expressed his admiration for the writing style of John Bunyan and Laurence Sterne, and the emotional authenticity of Thomas Hardy and Graham Greene.

South African academic Zoë Molver wrote that ""Make a Skyf, Man!"" ""offers a singular take on the Struggle because it entertains the reader rather than attempting to explain or persuade."" Michiel Heyns described the language of the book as a ""pot-pourri of slang, obscenity and invective, interspersed with passages of pure lyricism"".

"Legal cynicism

Legal cynicism is a domain of legal socialization defined by a perception that the legal system and law enforcement agents are ""illegitimate, unresponsive, and ill equipped to ensure public safety."" It is related to police legitimacy, and the two serve as important ways for researchers to study citizens' perceptions of law enforcement. 
Sampson and Bartusch (1998) defined legal cynicism as """"anomie"" about law"". Based on Sampson & Bartusch's work, and on that of Leo Srole, Piquero et al. (2005) defined it based on respondents' answers to a five-question survey. In the survey, respondents were asked to rank, on a four-point scale, the extent to which they agreed with each of these statements: 
Legal cynicism can be exacerbated when police engage in aggressive misconduct in a community, which can lead to greater violence and less cooperation between the community's citizens and the police. It has been found to be higher in neighborhoods with higher levels of concentrated disadvantage, even after controlling for demographic factors and crime rates. The strongest predictor of legal cynicism is self-reported delinquency.
Legal cynicism and legitimacy both have significant effects on criminal offending, even after accounting for self-control. Legal cynicism is also associated with lower rates of desistance from intimate partner violence, higher homicide rates, and higher recidivism rates among released prisoners. It has also been found to affect parents' assessments of their adolescent children's violent behavior.",Legal cynicism,903

Ralph Spence (died 12 May 1938) was a British trade unionist.

Born in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Spence became interested in trade unionism in the early 1880s. As a result, he took a leading role in founding the Tyneside and District Labourers' Union in 1888.

He was appointed as the union's Corresponding Secretary in 1898, and from 1912 represented the union at the Trades Union Congress.

In 1922, J. N. Bell, General Secretary of NAUL, died unexpectedly, and Spence was elected to succeed him. He took the union into a merger which formed the National Union of General and Municipal Workers, becoming one of the new union's first joint Assistant General Secretaries. He remained in this post until his retirement in 1935, and he died three years later.

"Société d'encouragement pour l'industrie nationale

The Société d'encouragement pour l'industrie nationale (Society for Encouraging National Industry) is an organization established in 1801 to encourage French industry.
Over the years it has provided prizes and support to inventors, promoted transfer of technology and management techniques, sponsored efforts to improve safety and efficiency and reduce pollution, and promoted vocational education. 

In 1800 Napoleon was firmly in power as ruler of France and the continental peace seemed assured.
Napoleon was resolved to make French industry greater than that of all other nations, particularly England.
At the initiative of the Minister of Interior Jean-Antoine Chaptal, the second Exposition des produits de l'industrie française was held in Paris from 19–25 September 1801.
Following this, a preparatory meeting for the Société d'encouragement pour l'industrie nationale was held on 4 october 1801 to discuss formation of a society similar to the British Royal Society of Arts to encourage and improve French industry.
A month later the opening meeting chaired by David Etienne Rouille de L'Etang (1731–1811) was held on 31 October 1801 with 92 attendees including the three Consuls.
Within a few weeks there were over 900 subscribers, including Napoleon Bonaparte with 100 subscriptions, Chaptal with 50 subscriptions, and many others with multiple subscriptions.

The third Exposition des produits de l'industrie française was held in 1802 and lasted seven days, with 540 exhibitors.
After this the government decided that more time was needed between the expositions to allow for advances in manufacturing to mature, and put off the next exposition until 1806.
In the interim the Société d'encouragement pour l'industrie nationale continued to give prizes for many branches of industry.
The society received considerable subsidies from Chaptal's ministry, which distributed its bulletin.
Between 1801 and 1845 the emphasis of the society was on stimulation of inventions, transfer of technology and improvements to business processes.
Hundred of inventors and researchers received support, as did various companies.
The society sponsored transfer of technology from foreign industrial companies, supported the expositions universelles and arranged for foundation of Arts & Crafts schools and the École centrale des arts et manufactures.

Between 1846 and 1885 the society undertook many initiatives to counter the negative effects of industrialization, such as protection of children working in factories, workplace hygiene and safety, reduction of pollution and unemployment funds.
The society continued to fund researchers, supported creation of regional industry societies and supported foundation of the École Libre des Sciences Politiques.
From 1886 to 1954 the emphasis was on encouraging industrial research, including energy saving and the fight against pollution, standardization, scientific management (Taylorism) and industrial design.
Édouard Gruner (1849–1933) was president of the Société d'encouragement pour l'industrie nationale from 1907 to 1909.
He was also president of the Houillères de la Haute-Loire, Aciéries de Paris et d'Outreau and the Société de l'industrie minérale, and was an advocate at the Musée social for these employer interests groups.

From 1930 the society sponsored conferences on advances in science and technology.From 1955 to 1993 the society encouraged teachers and researchers, research institutions and laboratories.
From 1994 the society tried to improve the status of the entrepreneur, support emerging talent, provide logistical support to emerging industries, and support vocational training.

"1981 Milwaukee Police Strike

The 1981 Milwaukee Police Strike was a police strike in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States. 

Three police-involved deaths in Milwaukee in 1981 have been cited as causes for a general increase in racial tension in the city that year. In December, two Milwaukee Police officers – John Machjewski and Charles Mehlberg – were shot and killed by Robert Lee Collins, an African-American man, while investigating a reported robbery at Alfred's House of Bourbon, a tavern. Following the deaths, Alderman Roy Nabors publicly stated that the shooting might have been motivated by the suspect's fear of the police. Nabors later said his comments had been taken out of context.

At approximately 8:00 p.m. on December 23, 1981, officers of the 1700-man Milwaukee Police abandoned their posts, citing Nabors' comments as evidence of the disregard they claimed city officials showed for the police. Mayor Henry Maier declared a state of emergency and, in response to a demand from the president of the Milwaukee Professional Police Association that the Milwaukee Common Council hear a list of police grievances before officers would return to work, convened an extraordinary session of the council. Maier also issued a request to bars and taverns in the city to voluntarily agree to close early for the duration of the strike. 

The first hours of the strike were met with confusion, with some police districts having a single police supervisor as the entire law enforcement presence. In one case, two officers on patrol didn't learn a strike had been called until an hour after it began. During the strike, law enforcement in Milwaukee was provided by a combination of police supervisors who had not joined the walk-out and 200 specially-assigned deputies of the Milwaukee County Sheriff's Office. Nonetheless, media reported that at least two police stations appeared to have shut-down with a hand-written sign on the locked doors of the district 7 station reading ""we are not conducting any business at this time.""

Police returned to work late on December 24, 1981 – approximately 16 hours after the strike began – after the Milwaukee Common Council agreed to publicly denounce Nabors, as well as to increase police funding.

As of 2009, Robert Collins was incarcerated at the Wisconsin Secure Program Facility.",1981 Milwaukee Police Strike,923
"Milenković family

Milenković family refers to a group of three people: Svetozar Milenković (1907-1983), Vida Milenković (1912-1992), and Aleksandar Petrović (1917-1944). They are honoured as Righteous Among the Nations for saving Jews from the Nazis in Serbia during World War II.

Svetozar was a Serbian Orthodox priest, and the son of a priest. Vida, his wife ( Petrović), was the daughter of Mihailo Petrović, who had been a Chetnik freedom fighter against the Ottomans. Aleksandar, her brother, was a Serbian Orthodox priest.

In 1941, the Nazis occupied Belgrade and began rounding up Jews. The Fenje family (the father (who had the title of Doctor), the mother, and their two daughters) fled to Raška to escape persecution; but the Nazis began to ""cleanse"" that town also of Jews. Many who had been friends or neighbours offered the Fenjes no help; but Svetosar and Vida did. They sheltered them in their own home, and arranged hiding places for the father and one daughter in nearby villages. Aleksandar arranged similar hiding places for the mother and the other daughter. The area was dangerous: Yugoslav Partisans were fighting the Germans, who were searching for and arresting everyone they considered undesirable.

"Pambikalbae

Pambikalbae is a monospecific genus known from the Ediacaran Period (approximately 570-542 million years ago) of South Australia. Its morphology resembles a cnidarian sea-pen.

""Pambikalbae"" had a broad, frondose-shaped body composed of multiple vanes extending from an axial stem, and containing a serial series of chambers. Specimens of ""Pambikalbae"" found thus far have measured approximately 20 to 30 cm in length, with a width of 12 cm at the widest point of the frondose-body, and 6.6 cm wide at the stem.

""Pambikalbae"" is a monospecific genus, with only one known species, ""P"". ""hasenohrae"".

""Pambikalbae hasenohrae"" was discovered within a fossiliferous exposure on the Nilpena pastoral property in the Flinders Ranges of South Australia. Pamela Hasenohr, an amateur geologist, found and brought the ""Pambikalbae"" fossils to the attention of Richard Jenkins, a research associate of the South Australian Museum. Richard Jenkins and his associate Chris Nedin collected five ""Pambikalbae"" specimens from this exposure, and published their description of the genus in 2007. In this publication, they named the type species of the genus, ""P. hasenohrae,"" after Pamela Hasenohr.

""Pambikalbae hasenohrae"" specimens have been found preserved in channel sandstones on the Nilpena pastoral property in the Flinders Ranges of South Australia. These sandstones occur directly below the Ediacaran Member of the Rawnsley Quartzite, a stratigraphic layer rich with Ediacaran fossils that was deposited during cycles of marine transgression.

""Pambikalbae hasenohrae"" fossils consist of both surface molds and internal casts. It is likely that the hollow chambers of these specimens were partly filled with sediments before their entire bodies were buried, preventing the bodies from being entirely flattened during burial and preserving the three-dimensional structure of both the internal and external parts of the original organisms. The lithified sands that occupy the once hollow parts of the specimens exhibit fine laminations and small scale crossbedding, which indicates that the specimens were buried progressively, not instantly. This gradual burial may have created enough time for currents to carry sediments into the internal chambers before the entire organism was buried. 

""Pambikalbae"" was likely a benthic, sessile, heterotrophic marine suspension feeder. The chambers of ""Pambikalbae"" were open to the external environment, allowing water to enter and exit freely. These chambers were likely lined with flagellate cells or cilia, which would capture detrital food particles suspended in the water.",Pambikalbae,935

State Road 145 (NM 145) is a , paved, two-lane state highway in Hidalgo County in the U.S. state of New Mexico. NM 145's western terminus is at the road's junction with NM 80, right after the road turns north passing through Peloncillo Mountains. The road's eastern terminus is north of Cotton City at the highway's junction with NM 338. NM 145 is also known as Goat Camp Road. 

NM 145 begins at the junction with NM 80, right after the road passes through the southern edge of Peloncillo Mountains, skirting the old lead mines. The road heads east through the arid sparsely populated desert plains occupied by ranchos. After 3.5 miles the road reaches its eastern terminus at the intersection with NM 338, just north of Cotton City.

The old Route 145 was created some time in 1930s, running from Route 184 near Black Springs to its intersection with Route 52. Shortly thereafter, Route 145 together with several other roads in the area were combined to form an extension of Route 78 which existed until 1988. After reorganization of 1988, the route was renamed NM 163.

A road connecting NM 80 to NM 338 first appears on the mid-1960s topographic maps, as a local paved highway.

Berthold Jacob (12 December 1898 Lisbon – 26 February 1944 Berlin) was a German journalist and pacifist.

Jacob experienced the First World War whilst serving on the western front in 1918. This led him to become a pacifist. He went on to become a radical critic of German militarism writing articles about German secret rearmament and the Feme murders. From 1923 he wrote a series of articles for ""Die Weltbühne"" under the pseudonym ""Old Soldier"". However, in 1928 he was prosecuted for treason and sentenced to nine months imprisonment.

Jacob left Germany for Strasbourg 1932. Here he set up an independent press service. However having been enticed to Basle by the undercover Gestapo agent Hans Wesemann, Jacob was kidnapped in March 1935. Jacob had known Wesemann for some time and had indeed served as best man at Wesemann's wedding. Wesemann was subsequently sentenced to three years in jail for the kidnapping. This was investigated by the Swiss police officer Anton Ganz, who went to London to interview such people as Dora Fabian and Karl Korsch. The subsequent death of Fabian alongside her friend Mathilde Wurm led to concern that they had been murdered rather than the suicide which was the verdict of the coroner's court. This contributed to the climate of opinion which led to a successful campaign for his release from Germany. This campaign was based on Swiss diplomatic pressure and German exile protests.

Upon his return to Switzerland he was deported to France. Here he continued his work until the outbreak of the Second world War. He was interned with his wife in the south of France in 1939/40. However they managed to escape from Marseille travelling to Portugal in 1941. Jacob was one of the refugees aided by Varian Fry.

"Fernando Martínez de Espinosa y Echeverri

Fernando Martínez de Espinosa y Echeverri was a Spanish admiral and the second Chief of Staff of the Spanish Navy. He held the post from 19 March until 22 October 1896. In the summer of 1895 Espinosa had commanded the Spanish squadron that represented their country at the opening of the Kiel Canal from the ""Infanta Maria Teresa"". During the Spanish–American War, he was present at a meeting of senior Spanish naval officers chaired by Segismundo Bermejo y Merelo, the minister of the navy at the time, on 23 April 1898. Espinosa supported the idea of sending Admiral Pascual Cervera y Topete's squadron from Cape Verde to the Spanish colonies in the Caribbean (Cuba and Puerto Rico). This decision was adopted by the majority of the members which led to the Battle of Santiago de Cuba. Espinosa was made Commander of the Order of Charles III in 1882 and awarded the Grand Cross of the Royal and Military Order of Saint Hermenegild on 30 October 1889.",Fernando Martínez de Espinosa y Echeverri,979

"Quintus Fulvius Gillo Bittius Proculus

Quintus Fulvius Gillo Bittius Proculus was a Roman senator who held at least one office in imperial service. He was suffect consul for the ""nundinium"" November-December AD 98 with Publius Julius Lupus as his colleague. He is also known by the shorter form of his name, Quintus Bittius Proculus.

Proculus' familiar connections has been a matter of dispute. A number of scholars have attempted to connect him to the suffect consul of the year 76, Marcus Fulvius Gillo. Some have suggested that he was the son of the older Gillo; others that he was adopted by the older man. In his monograph on Roman naming practices, Olli Salomies finds either possibility unlikely, and points out the more likely possibilities are that ""he could be a Bittius adopted by a Q. Fulvius; or he could be a Bittius whose mother was a sister of, or in some other way related to, M. Fulvius Gillo."" Pliny the Younger refers to him in passing as the stepfather of his second wife, which would make him the husband of Pompeia Celerina.

The ""cursus honorum"" of Proculus is known only in piecemeal. The earliest office attested for him is as prefect of the ""aerarii Saturnii"", which he held as the colleague of Publicius Certus; Mireille Corbier dated his tenure of this office to the years 96 and 97. This financial office usually directly led its officehelder to acceding to the consulate, but the prosecution of Pliny the Younger, although it failed to convict Certus, prevented him from reaching that office. 

The other office Proculus is known to have held is proconsular governor of Asia; an inscription at Cyzicus allows his tenure to be dated to 115/116. 

Proculus is attested to have been admitted to the Arval Brethren by the year 101. The inscriptions of this priesthood attest he attended their rituals in the years 105, 117, and 118. It is from the records of this priesthood that we learn he had died by 7 February 120, when Publius Malius Garbo was co-opted to fill the vacancy created by his death.",Quintus Fulvius Gillo Bittius Proculus,985
"Ephorize

Ephorize is the third studio album by American rapper Cupcakke. It was self-released on January 5, 2018 via TuneCore, after being announced on her official Twitter.

On December 20, 2017, Cupcakke revealed the title and cover art of the album through Twitter. The track listing was announced on December 27, 2017, via her Twitter account.

On December 29, 2017, Cupcakke announced the album pre-order on Twitter.

""Pitchfork"" believed ""Ephorize""s themes to be ""self-esteem, LGBTQ issues, and the desire for genuine romance"" and compared Cupcakke's ""absurdist one-liners"" to Ghostface Killah. HotNewHipHop believed the album to be ""one of the most introspective bodies of work she's dropped off to date"". ""The Observer"" described the album's production as a mix of ""old-school hip-hop, futuristic pop and [..] Latin"".

""Duck Duck Goose"" has been described as a sex rap song that ""flirts with New Orleans bounce"". ""Total"" was described as ""[embracing] the muted dembow pop varietal known as tropical house"". The synth flute lines in ""Navel"" were likened to the synth flutes used in ""Mask Off"". ""Crayons"", which has been dubbed a ""pro-LGBTQ anthem"", features reggaeton percussion, and lyrics ""in praise of the queer community"". ""Meet and Greet"" and ""Wisdom Teeth"" are drill songs ""with added gloss"". Lyrically, ""Cartoons"" has been described as ""[flipping] children's icons into totems for not taking shit"". ""Self Interview"" depicts ""the external expectations put on women as they transition from childhood to adulthood"", particularly through the line ""Back then we had lipgloss and some overalls, that's the usual/Nowadays I gotta show skin and wear sew-ins to feel beautiful"".

""Exit"" was released as the first single off the album as a digital download on September 15, 2017. ""Cartoons"" was released as the second single on November 10, 2017.

""Exit"" received a music video on October 13, 2017. ""Cartoons"" received a music video on November 18, 2017. ""Duck Duck Goose"" received a music video on January 15, 2018.

The album received ""rave reviews"", with several music sites praising its evolution from Harris's previous projects. MTV UK described it as ""further proof that she's one of the most versatile, quick-witted and consistent rappers in the game."" ""Exclaim!"" stated that ""the latest offering hears Cupcakke presenting her most polished work to date, though she still slides in plenty of deliciously dirty one-liners throughout the new record."" HotNewHipHop noted that ""cupcakKe's attitude is one of the many stand-out attributes in her music. While the raunchiness in her music has been a quality that she's known for, she still touches on more serious topics at the same time. Ephorize might be one of the most introspective bodies of work she's dropped off to date."" ""Pitchfork"" awarded the album with the publication's ""Best New Music"" accolade, calling it Cupcakke's ""best album yet, with terrific production and a barrage of raps that reveal Elizabeth Harris to be far more than her hilarious and absurdly raunchy one-liners"". Writing for Vulture, Craig Jenkins noted that """"Ephorize""’s introspective moments give it depth to match its more colorful material's brusqueness and vulgarity."" He also stated that ""at her best, CupcakKe is a semi-automatic fully loaded with ridiculous puns.""",Ephorize,986

"McDonnell Hall

McDonnell Hall, formerly Our Lady of Guadalupe Mission Chapel and St. Martin of Tours Church, is a historic church building on the campus of Our Lady of Guadalupe Church at 2020 East San Antonio Street in San Jose, California. Built in 1914, this building now serves as the parish hall for the church. It is historically important for its association with labor and civil rights activist Cesar Chavez, who attended church in this building, and conducted labor and community organizing activities here. The building was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2016.

Our Lady of Guadalupe Church is located northeast of downtown San Jose in its Mayfair neighborhood, on the south side of East San Antonio Street east of its junction with South Sunset Avenue. The main church building is a six-sided modern structure, built in 1968. McDonnell Hall stands in the parking area on the east side of the church building. It is a basically rectangular single-story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and stucco exterior. The north-facing short facade houses its main entrance, sheltered by a gabled portico. The interior has been substantially altered for use from its original religious functions, to house meeting spaces, a kitchen, classrooms, and storage.

McDonnell Hall was built in 1914 to a design by San Jose architect Louis Lenzen, and was originally located in West San Jose, where it housed the congregation called St. Martin of Tours. In 1923, this congregation added wings to each side of the building, giving it a cruciform shape, and was again renovated in 1948. In 1953, the St. Martin's congregation sold the building to the Roman Catholic parish of St. Patrick's, which wanted to establish a mission in Mayfair to better serve the large Mexican and Mexican-American Catholic population that lived there. The building was broken down and reconstructed near its present location, and from 1953 to 1968 it housed the growing Our Lady of Guadalupe congregation. The building was formally upgraded from a chapel to a church in 1960. After construction of the modern church, the building was moved northwest, in order to accommodate the city's development of Mayfair Park. It was moved and deconsecrated in 1974-75.

The building is historically significant for its association with labor leader and civil rights activist Cesar Chavez. Chavez, a Roman Catholic, was a friend of Father Donald McDonnell, the priest who first led Our Lady of Guadalupe, and helped in the relocation of the building and its reconsecration as a Roman Catholic chapel in 1953. The chapel became home to Chavez' chapter of the Community Service Organization, an important training ground for his later activism. Chavez moved from San Jose to Oxnard in 1958.",McDonnell Hall,995
