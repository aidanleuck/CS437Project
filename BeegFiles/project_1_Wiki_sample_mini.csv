Bo Diddley said of the song: ""A lot of the things I did in the Chess studios, we were just goofin' around... They played it back, and it shocked all of us! Of course, they cut out all the dirty parts."" Music critic Maury Dean, while rejecting the idea that the track is ""the first rap song"", says that it is ""the first major soul tune to feature a total spoken patter of pal put-downs to a rockin' beat... Bo's lightning right hand chops chords like sugar cane. The incessant beat throbs into the hot American evening nocturne of streetwise savvy. Rap - with a side of ghetto-blast humor.""

The portal of the balcony is also rich with baroque decorations, with two pilasters, other garnitures on both sides, ending with three masks, the biggest one in the middle; the family emblem dominates the tympanum: it is formed by a heart confixed by an arrow and surmounted by the baronial crown.

The other five balconies on the first floor are made with carved stone; the brackets are fluted and have some decorations; on the second floor there are five stone balconies, two windows and two recent balconies. 

As soon as you enter the lobby, there is an atrium: today, of the two ancient staircases, there is only the one leading to the first floor; in the late 19th century they built another staircase leading up to the second floor.

The palace is situated between the Church of Saint Nicholas of Bari (along corso 6 Aprile) and via Porta Stella, where there are two other entrances on the first floor, leading to its eight rooms with accessories, and to the ten rooms existing on the second floor.

The site was discovered by a group of archaeologists, during an archaeological excavation done in the Sampur area in December 2017. However the ruins, including an old Stupa were completely destroyed and flattened out by a group of vandals on 18 December, few days after the discovery.

During the Sri Lankan civil war, many of the archaeological sites in the North and Eastern provinces of Sri Lanka were not properly investigated or recorded as the prevailed threats from the LTTE rebel group. After the defeat of LTTE in 2009, the archaeology department carried out several projects across the North & Eastern provinces to investigate and identify the places with archaeological evidences and the some of places were finally declared as archaeologically protected reserves and monuments. As the instructions given by Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, a similar project was started after the 2015 to investigate the unknown archaeological sites in the Eastern province of the country. In December 2017, as a part of the project a group of archaeologists unearthed a dilapidated Stupa during an excavation done in a Hindu temple premises in Soodaikudah in Sampur. According to the initial evaluations done by the archaeologists, the Stupa is a construction of early Anuradhapura period (377 BC to 1017 AD) with a girth of 15 feet.

The ruins of the stupa were found on land which is used by a recently built Hindu shrine. The local people in Soodaikudah are said to be displaced in 2006 along with Muttur people and had been resettling around the area from 2013. The Hindu shrine, constructed near to the stupa mound, was officially registered in 2014.

A few days after the identification, the Stupa mound had been cleared completely by a group of people using a bulldozer before the Department declared it as an archaeologically and historically important site. The destruction was first revealed by police who conducted investigations following a tip-off given on the police hotline. The incident was reported to the authorities including the Secretary to the President and the Eastern Province Governor by the chief monk of Seruvila Mangala Raja Maha Vihara. A police investigation was started following the incident and meanwhile a court order was issued by the Muttur magistrate, suspending all rehabilitation works on the Hindu temple.

On 23 December, the speaker Karu Jayasuriya revealed that the people who destroyed the Soodaikudah Stupa in Sampur has been identified. A few days after the statement, three people were arrested with a bulldozer and a lorry which were used to destroy the Stupa. The bulldozer had been brought to the Hindu shrine to dig a drinking well around 100 metres away from the Kovil but they had used the vehicle to destroy the Stupa. Local media reported that the two drivers involved in the destruction of the Stupa had met with accidents at different places on the same day.

After communist takeovers of both Poland and mainland China, there had been no official diplomatic mission between two states. Communist Poland only considered the newly-established People's Republic of China as the sole representative of China, while the Taiwan-relocated Republic of China was hostile to all communist factors.

Since the end of communism in 1989, Poland and Taiwan had started embracing a stronger and advocating tie. Being allies of the United States and have enjoyed a large decree of success with democratic ideals, the two nations seek to tie stronger.

Mungret Abbey is a medieval friary and National Monument located in County Limerick, Ireland.

Mungret Abbey is located immediately west of Dooradoyle and northeast of Mungret College, southwest of Limerick city centre, to the south of the Shannon Estuary.

Mungret was an early monastic site, founded before AD 551 by Saint Nessan (Neasán) the Deacon. At one point there may have been as many as 1,500 monks and six churches operating.

John O'Donovan claimed a fourth-century date, predating Saint Patrick.

In 908, Cormac mac Cuilennáin, King of Munster, gifted the abbey three ounces of gold and a satin chasuble.

It was plundered on four occasions in the 9th century by Vikings. High King Domnall Ua Lochlainn destroyed the monastery in 1107.

Mungret claimed episcopal status 1152, but was deemed to be too close to Limerick. 1179 the then king of Munster, Domnall Mór Ua Briain, granted the monastery to Brictius, Bishop of Limerick.

Mungret then became a parish church (built 1251−72), operated by the Augustinian Canons Regular.

Mungret Abbey church was used by the Church of Ireland until 1822. The antiquary Austin Cooper wrote about Mungret in 1781.

The building was extended and the tower, the priest's living quarters, was added during the 15th century.

A bell was found at Loghmore nearby, called the Bell of Mungret.

Since the Troubles began the South Armagh area, especially around Crossmaglen, was one of the most dangerous places for the British security forces, and the IRA's South Armagh brigade carried out numerous ambushes on the British Army and the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC). This included the 1975 Drummuckavall ambush and the 1978 downing of a British Army Gazelle helicopter.

When the patrol was near St Patrick's Church, a red Royal Mail-type van fitted with armor plating drove past the patrol and came to a sudden stop. IRA members opened fire from the back of the van with an M60 machine gun and AR-15 rifles. The British soldiers returned fire but did not claim any hits. Christmas shoppers scrambled for cover. Three soldiers at the front of the patrol were fatally wounded. They were taken to Musgrave Park Hospital but were declared dead on arrival.

Dr. Shuhei Ono is an associate professor of earth, atmospheric, and planetary sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In his research, he measures isotopes of sulfur and other elements to investigate water-rock-microbe interactions, seafloor hydrothermal systems, the deep biosphere, and global sulfur cycles.

Dr. Shuhei Ono earned his B.S. in geology in 1994 and his M.E. in economic geology in 1996 from Waseda University in Tokyo, Japan. He completed his Ph.D. in geochemistry from Pennsylvania State University in 2001. Ono joined the Geophysical Laboratory of Carnegie Institution of Washington to complete his postdoctoral research, and in 2006 received a geobiology fellowship from the Agouron Institute to support his work. In 2007, Ono became a faculty member at MIT.

Ono earned the 2017 Paul Gast Lectureship award from the European Association of Geochemistry, given to mid-career scientists who have made outstanding contributions to geochemistry.

Ono has developed an instrument that uses tunable infrared laser direct absorption spectroscopy to detect the ratio of different isotopes in a sample of methane, which can indicate the methane’s source. The instrument has enabled his group to discover the origins of methane from seafloor hot springs, and to understand the effects of microbial and atmospheric methane cycling on the isotopic composition of methane in a sample.

Ono’s team also measures sulfur isotopes to study how early microbial life impacted atmospheric and ocean chemistry. Specifically, they are looking at Archean rocks in South Africa and Western Australia that are 4 to 2.5 billion years old. They also are using sulfur isotopes to investigate sulfur cycling within mid-ocean ridge hydrothermal vent systems and sulfate reduction in the deep subsurface.

Additionally, Ono collaborates with Massachusetts Institute of Technology Professor of Atmospheric Science Ronald Prinn to explore the natural and environmental sources of nitrous oxide, a powerful greenhouse gas and catalyst that destroys ozone.",Shuhei Ono,60

"Schooner barge

A schooner barge is a type of ship; a schooner converted as a barge. Schooner barges originated on the Great Lakes in the 1860's and were in use until World War II, although a few survived into the 1950s.

Even though steamboats were used for time-critical routes such as for passengers and mail, schooners were still economical to use for bulk cargoes such as grain, wood, or iron ore. Steam tugs were introduced on the Great Lakes that could tow one or more barges. Since old schooners were available, they could be adapted to towing service with reduced crews. When winds were favorable, the schooner barge could have one or two sails rigged to save fuel in the steam tug. Eventually schooner-rigged wooden ships were purposely built for use as barges. The concept was later extended to salt-water use, with, for example, the United States Navy converting some schooners for use as barges for coal. 

Because of rough weather and small crews, schooner barges were frequently lost from tows, set adrift during bad weather, or sunk. By the 1920's, schooner barges were no longer in practical use on the Great Lakes since steam and diesel powered ships provided better operating flexibility and safety, with lower crew costs than a tug and barges hauling the same amount of cargo.",Schooner barge,71

"The Army of a Dream

The Army of a Dream is a speculative fiction short story written by Rudyard Kipling, published in the Morning Post in June 1904. It models an alternate way of organizing the military, along lines of responsibility and competence instead of heredity and privilege, as he had seen that the British Military was at that time.

Using indirect exposition, Kipling conveys to the reader that the narrator is experiencing the story as a dream. The story itself involves a military man taking the narrator around and showing off his military unit, the ""Tynesiders"". It is revealed that in their society, military service is voluntary, but almost universal, because only those who have served may vote, along with a number of other incentives. Unlike military forces common through much of history, those of the story are not authoritarian or what one might otherwise call ""militaristic"", but are a sort of citizen militia composed of competent men focused on dealing with any threat to their community and nation.

Rudyard Kipling was, in general, a major influence on one of the 20th century's most influential writers, Robert A. Heinlein. In his seminal work Starship Troopers, Heinlein models a similar society, where one is not a citizen unless one becomes a veteran of government service. While this does not have to be in combat forces but is actually more like being a civil servant, that novel follows characters in the mobile infantry, and is in fact the origin of the mech trope that has pervaded science fiction since. Also foreshadowed is Heinlein's fondness for the competent hero, a character who — though usually bearing normal human flaws — is rugged and self-responsible, able to do most things at least on a fundamental level and functioning with a high level of confidence and self-actualization.",The Army of a Dream,78

"Elmer S. Rigdon

Elmer S. Rigdon (June 16, 1868-December 13, 1922) was a member of the California State Senate from Cambria, California. He was the key proponent for building the Carmel-San Simeon Highway along the Big Sur coast. He was a member of the California Senate Committee on Roads and Highways and during World War I promoted the military necessity of defending California's coast. He persuaded the legislature to approve the project. In 1919, the legislature approved submission of a bond measure to voters. 

He was the son of Rufus Rigdon and Indiana Scott Rigdon. His parents homesteaded in Cambria during the 1860s. Elmer Rigdon became a rancher and timber harvester. He also owned a brickyard in Cambria and the Bank Mine on San Simeon Creek. He extracted quicksilver from the mine from 1903 to 1906, when he sold his interest. He was elected to the California state assembly in 1914 and to the state senate in 1916.

Dr. John L. D. Roberts, who founded Seaside, California, had a strong interest in building a road along the California central coast. In 1897, he walked the entire stretch of rocky coast from from Monterey to San Luis Obispo in five days and mapped out the course of the future road. He photographed the land and became the first surveyor of the route. In 1915, he presented the results of his survey and photographic work to a joint session of the California legislature. Roberts initially promoted the coastal highway to allow access to a region of spectacular beauty, but failed to obtain funding. Rigdon embraced the necessity of building the road. As a member of the California Senate Committee on Roads and Highways during World War I, he promoted the military necessity of defending California's coast and persuaded the legislature to support the project. The $1.5 million bond issue was approved by voters, but construction was delayed by World War I. Federal funds were appropriated and in 1921 voters approved additional state funds.

Rigdon died in office before the highway was completed. At the dedication of the highway on On June 27, 1937, his wife dedicated a silver fir to her husband's memory. A small park and drinking fountain in a turnout between Vicente Creek Bridge and Big Creek Bridge, north of Lucia. was dedicated as the Elmer Rigdon Memorial Drinking Fountain.",Elmer S  Rigdon,88

"Pseudo K-tuple nucleotide composition

The Pseudo K-tuple nucleotide composition or PseKNC, was extended from Chou’s Pseudo amino acid composition or PseAAC . Both PseAAC and PseKNC are of vector descriptor, but the former represents protein or peptide sequences while the latter represents DNA or RNA sequences. 

To avoid completely losing the sequence-order information for protein and peptide sequences, the pseudo amino acid composition or PseAAC was proposed by Kuo-Chen Chou. But how about for DNA and RNA sequences? To address this problem, the pseudo K-tuple nucleotide composition or PseKNC was proposed. For the convenience scientific community, a freely available web server, called PseKNC and an open source package, called PseKNC-General were developed in 2013 and 2014, which could convert large-scale sequence datasets to pseudo nucleotide compositions with numerous choices of physicochemical property combinations. PseKNC-General can generate several modes of pseudo nucleotide compositions, including conventional k-tuple nucleotide compositions, Moreau–Broto autocorrelation coefficient, Moran autocorrelation coefficient,Geary autocorrelation coefficient, Type I PseKNC and Type II PseKNC. 

Like PseAAC in computational proteomics and proteome analysis, PseKNC has also been increasingly used in computational genomics and performing various genome analyses.",Pseudo K tuple nucleotide composition,99

"Nairobi College

Nairobi College was a small radical left junior college in East Palo Alto, California for ethnic minority students in the late 1960s.

The College was part of a movement for ethnic minority groups in the United States to have dedicated academic programs to train themselves in the theory and practice of liberation, resistance, and revolution. These programs were referred to as ""Third world colleges"", which sought to practice the principles of self-determination and community empowerment while teaching left-radical ideology in rejection of the perceived bourgeois ideology and white control of mainstream academic institutions. Prominent advocates for this movement included graduate student Angela Davis and professors Herbert Marcuse of the University of California San Diego and Carlos Blanco of Thurgood Marshall College. Other colleges founded as part of this movement included Malcolm X Liberation University, Uhuru Sasa Shule, the Center for Black Education, and Thurgood Marshall College.

Nairobi College began classes in the fall of 1960 with initial funding of $100,000 donated by area residents and private foundations.. 20,000 books were donated by schools, individuals, and publishers, which were kept in two residential garages. Anyone at least 16 years of age was welcome to enroll at no cost. The first class had working-class 100 students, some of whom were high school dropouts. The all-volunteer faculty numbered about 40 and consisted of student and professors from nearby universities as well as community organizers.
Based out of a small private home in East Palo Alto, Nairobi College operated out of stores, church buildings, and homes throughout black, Latino, and Asian neighborhoods in the San Francisco Peninsula.
The college leadership hoped that spreading classes out in these existing structures would integrate it with the needs and reality of their surrounding community, calling it a ""college without walls"" in contrast to the perceived ""ivory tower"" of mainstream academia. It was a two-year college.

The students were primarily African American and Hispanic, although working-class white students were also included. Most of them worked full time and took classes in the evenings. All students were required to utilize their training to provide skilled volunteer work three hours per week in support of area social organizations, such as schools, community health centers, and legal aid.

Instructors included Ed Roberts, a disability rights activist, Tello Nkhereanye, a leftist from South Africa, Frank Omowale Satterwhite, a community organizer, Aaron Manganello, a Marxist minister of education for the Brown Berets, and Mary Hoover, a Stanford academic advocate for African-American English.

"Corral del Coliseo

The Corral del Coliseo is an old corral de comedias (a Spanish theatre) of 16th century in Seville (Andalusia, Spain), near the Plaza de la Encarnación square, which was later converted into a corral of neighbors and is currently is used as a residential building.

It has been documented that in March of 1612, ""Claramonte"" directs the Corral del Coliseo in Seville, and promises to provide the Company with ""eight old or already premiered comedies for four hundred reales, and new or never seen, at a rate of 250 reales"". It is also known that in 1620, ""Ortiz y los Valencianos"" represented the work of ""Claramonte"" ""The Great King of the Deserts"" in the Corral del Coliseo. In this same year the Corral del Coliseo suffered a devastating fire.

A lawsuit in 1619 between the owner of the Corral del Coliseo and some authors of comedies also serves as a guide to understand the society of the time. The complaint was lodged by Francisco de Rivera, landlord of the Corral del Coliseo, on June 5, 1619, before Juan Muñoz de Escovar, """"of the Council and Accountant major of accounts of His Majesty, Judge of the Performance of this city of Seville"""", against Juan Acacio and Diego de Vallejo (both authors of comedies), because they decided to represent the autos sacramentales of Corpus Christi in the ""Corral de doña Elvira"". With this, they contravened a previous resolution, of May 25, of the same judge in which he arranged to be represented in the Corral del Coliseo. For what said the landlord of the Corral """"...because such contempt should not be given, to your mercy I beg and beg, command to arrest the said authors of comedies, which are Juan Acacio and Diego de Vallejo, and remove the posters that are placed, executing them for the penalties in which they have incurred and in the damages that the treasury of this city for the said cause have been followed and continue, and I ask for justice. / So for proof of the above, I make a demonstration of one of the posters that the aforementioned have posted by the corners and the auto for your mercy provided and notifications, and I ask for justice..."""". They serve these writings to revive the society of the time and understand the theater of the Spanish golden age.

The Warakamai, now more frequently known as the Warrgamay, are an indigenous Australian people of the state of Queensland.

Their language, Warrgamay, is now extinct. It was a variety of Dyirbalic, and appears to be composed of three distinct dialects:""Wargamaygan"" spoken around the lower reaches of the Herbert River; ""Biyay"" spoken at the mouth of the Herbert, in the area of Halifax and Bemerside; and ""Hinchinbrook Biyay,"" spoken around the coastal area south of Cardwell and offshore on Hinchinbrook Island.

The Warakamai were the indigenous people of Halifax Bay, and held in Norman Tindale's calculations, approximately of tribal domains. An early resident, James Cassady, specified that they had 50 miles of shortline extending into the hinterland approximately 15 miles. Their northern neighbours were the Girramay, while to their south lay the Wulgurukaba.

The Warakamai were divided into several hordes:

The intermarriage of groups has been classified as follows:

Circumcision as an initiatory rite was unknown among the Warakamai. They did practice tooth avulsion, ritual scarification and piercing of the septum to wear nose bones. Polygamy was common, and widows were married to their deceased husband's brother.

The area of Halifax Bay first began to be settled by white colonialists in 1865. At that time the numbers of Warakami were estimated to amount to roughly 500 people. Within 15 years, they had declined by 300, a mere 40 of the surviving 200 being men. The difference was due to their being relentlessly hunted and gunned down by mounted native troopers under white supervision, together with settlers, both of whom 'shot as many of the males of the tribe as possible.'",Warakamai,135

Peter Henry Jones (1 March 1917 – 30 July 1984), was born in Monmouth and is best known for his role in assisting Sir Clement Price Thomas in the pneumonectomy of King George VI in 1951. 

He subsequently remained professionally close to Price Thomas, pursuing a career in Cardiothoracic surgery.
Jones was educated in Pontypool at Haberdashers' Aske's West Monmouth School.

Qualifying in medicine from Westminster Hospital Medical School in 1939, Jones stayed on at the hospital to complete his junior house posts. Between 1942 and 1946, he joined the Royal Army Medical Corps as a regimental medical officer to a field artillery regiment in North Africa and Italy. He witnessed the Salerno landing and the attack on Monte Cassino. Declining an elevation in rank, he opted to endure the rest of the war along with his regiment. Returning to England in 1946, Jones continued his surgical training and passed the FRCS in 1948. Afterwards, he joined the surgical team under Sir Clement Price Thomas at the Brompton Hospital and Westminster Hospitals.

Baguley and Davyhulme Hospitals appointed Jones as thoracic surgeon in 1955 and Manchester Royal Infirmary took him on in 1960. Also, in 1960, Jones attended the Presbyterian Hospital in San Francisco to learn new techniques in open heart surgery. After spending six months with Dr Frank Gerbode, he returned to Westminster Hospital as thoracic surgeon. 

As Hunterian Professor, he gave a lecture on bronchial sleeve resection in 1958. 

In 1951, Jones spent three weeks as resident surgeon in Buckingham Palace. On 23 September 1951, whilst still in the palace, he had assisted Price Thomas with the pneumonectomy on King George VI’s lung cancer. In return, he was awarded the MVO. The surgery has since been researched and re-enacted by real surgeons in Stephen Daldry's The Crown (TV series).

Jones enjoyed fishing and antique clocks. Coronary artery disease and an illness resulting in loss of voice limited his activities and resulted in his premature retirement.

"Facing It

""Facing It"" is a poem by American poet and author Yusef Komunyakaa. It is a reflection on Komunyakaa's first visit to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Komunyakaa served in Vietnam from 1969 to 1970, during which time he wrote for army newspaper ""Southern Cross"". It is the second poem written by Komunyakaa about Vietnam. R. S. Gwynn has referred to the poem as “the most poignant elegy that has been written about the Vietnam War.” 

The poem was his second to deal with the topic of the Vietnam War. He first wrote a poem dealing with Vietnam fourteen years after returning from the war. ""Facing It"" was written approximately a year after visiting the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Komunyakaa has said ""Facing It"" influenced the other poems of the collection in which it was first published, ""Dien Cai Dau"".

The poem concerns the speaker's visit to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, a black gabbro wall engraved with the names of American soldiers who died in the war. The wall is polished so that it is reflective.

Like jazz, the poem appears to be free of form, but it is in fact split into a verse-bridge-verse structure similar to many jazz songs. The first thirteen lines reflect on the speaker's reaction, and the final thirteen reflect on the reactions of others; these two sections are separated by a shorter section describing the act of finding and touching a name.

The poem is one of several by Vietnam veterans to deal with memorials. Andrew Palmer and Sally Minogue have contrasted the ""ambivalent response"" of ""Facing It"" with W. D. Ehrhart's ""The Invasion of Grenada"", in which the speaker rejects the idea of a Vietnam memorial and refuses to engage with ""...that
vast black wall of broken lives"".

The poem has been anthologized in a number of collections, and is perhaps Komunyakaa's best known work.",Facing It,142

The brass is in front of the monument to Etchingham's ancestors. The Latin inscription under Elizabeth Etchingham identifies her as the first daughter of Thomas and Margaret Etchingham. The text under Agnes Oxenbridge identifies her as the daughter of Robert Oxenbridge. Both Judith M. Bennett in ""The Lesbian Premodern"" than Alan Bray in ""Homosexuality in Renaissance England"" recognized the memorial brass like those made for a married couple and therefore think that the one between Oxenbridge and Etchingham was a particular friendship, probably a medieval example of Lesbian relationship.

Elizabeth Etchingham was the daughter of Thomas Etchingham II (1424/25 - 1486) and Margaret West, daughter of Reginald West, 6th Baron De La Warr. The monument to Thomas Etchingham I and his parents is in front of the memorial brass of his granddaughter.

Agnes Oxenbridge was the daughter of Robert Oxenbridge (died 1487), of Brede, and his wife Ann Livelode (or Anne Lyvelode) (died 1494).

The Etchingham and Oxenbridge families were deeply connected: Thomas Oxenbridge (died 1540) inherited both Etchingham and Mountfield manors from his mother Elizabeth, sister of Elizabeth Etchingham, born in 1460, 8 years after the death of her sister; she married in 1500 Goddard Oxenbridge (died 1531), son of Robert Oxenbridge and Anne Lyvelode, and therefore brother of Agnes Oxenbridge.",Agnes Oxenbridge and Elizabeth Etchingham,145

Nicolucci's first criminal conviction in Canada came in 1973 for drug possession, followed by possessing $2 million of counterfeit money in 1978. Nicolucci became a confidante of Vito Rizzuto, who went on a trip to Venezuela in 1984 where they met the allied Cuntrera-Caruana Mafia clan, regarded as drug specialists. That same year, a probe into Nicolucci's drug trafficking by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) found 12 kilograms of cocaine at Vancouver International Airport in false bottom suitcases intended for pick up by Montreal associate William Papier. The RCMP kept close surveillance on Nicolucci and Papier in Montreal through wiretaps, and even followed them by plane to Caracas, Venezuela where they received help from the United States Embassy in Venezuela, and bugged the mobsters hotel rooms. In 1985, the RCMP amassed enough evidence on Nicolucci and Papier, and the two were convicted and sentenced to 14 years in prison in Montreal Superior Court in relation to the Vancouver haul; they appealed, but the verdict was upheld.

In 1991, serving less than half his sentence, Nicolucci was released on parole. Within months of Nicolucci's release, he was money laundering, moving $31 million through a phony currency exchange in Montreal secretly run by the RCMP in an elaborate sting operation. Officers traced a $1.7-million purchase of 280 kilograms of cocaine made by Nicolucci on behalf of Vito Rizzuto. However, Nicolucci refused to pay the debt to the Colombian Cali cartel, claiming the cocaine was of poor quality. As a result, the Colombians kidnapped Nicolucci from Castel Tina on August 2, 1994, a Montreal strip club he managed, and smuggled him across the border to Miami, Florida, and then into Colombia. With an international warrant for Nicolucci's arrest, the Colombian police found Nicolucci in a house in Cali, Colombia in February 1995. He was extradited back to Canada and brought back to Montreal on May 30, 1996. Nicolucci was found guilty of 437 charges for drug trafficking and money laundering, and sentenced to 19 years in prison.

Colin Robertson (born 1983), known as Millennial Woes or simply Woes, is a Scottish alt-right, neoreactionary political activist, blogger and YouTube personality. He describe himself as a neoreactionary and ""white advocate"", and openly identifies with the alt-right. He has been described as a far-right, white nationalist, white supremacist, ""garden-variety"" racist across media, and frequently publishes content that is critical of multiculturalism. He has been described as a ""household name"" and a ""darling"" of the alt-right, as well as a ""rising star of the movement"".

Woes attended a London art college in Tooting in the mid-2000s, an experience he describes as 'dizzying' due to the ethnic diversity of the school and district. After a period of clinical depression, unemployment and underemployment, he launched his YouTube channel at the end of 2013. ""Vice"" had labeled his platform a ""popular alt-right YouTube channel"" towards the end of 2016, with around 18,000 subscribers and 2.4 million views.

In November 2016, Woes delivered a speech at the National Policy Institute Conference 2017, in Washington DC. According to some media, his involvement was directly linked to then President-elect Donald Trump's disavowing of NPI. A few days after Trump's election, Woes spoke in Seattle, claiming that he did not believe the President-elect was a ""rabid white nationalist"", but that ""restor[ing] America"" may mean getting ""more white people here and fewer brown people"".

In January 2017, he began receiving coverage from BBC News and national newspapers, after Scottish tabloid the ""Daily Record"" claimed to have doxxed Millenial Woes, ""expos[ing]"" his birth name, family's home address and sending reporters to confront him. Woes was reported to have ""left Britain"", posting a video to his Youtube channel named ""Fugitive Woes"". UK-based Civil rights group Civil Liberty defended him, claiming the doxxing was a ""hate campaign fomented by ""[The] Daily Mirror"""", while men's issues blog Return of Kings claimed British ""media outlets"" were ""attempting to incite a mob against him"".

On 6 February 2017, he gave a speech entitled """"Withnail and I as Viewed From the Right"""" at The London Forum in Kensington, which ""The Independent"" described as ""a meeting of prominent far-right voices"". Hope Not Hate covered his appearance at the event, claiming he recited the Fourteen Words as part of his speech. On 25 February 2017, Woes gave a speech in Stockholm organised by , which had been promoted as ""the most important alt-right conference in Europe"". According to IBTimes, the event took place in a ""secret location"" in Södermalm. In August 2017, ""Salon"" claimed that Millennial Woes was one of only a few alt-right platforms to rapidly grow, alongside Red Ice, VDARE and The Rebel Media.

On 10 December 2017, according to Right Wing Watch he began a interview series named ""Millenniyule 2017"", interviewing various internet personalities from the alt-right movement, including an appearance from Faith Goldy.

Woes is a follower of the white genocide conspiracy theory, and it has been reported as ""central to his beliefs"". He has been described in media as an anti-Semite, and identified himself as one. Describing what he called the ""Jewish Question"", he claimed that ""there are problems with the Jewish people""..",Millennial Woes,163

"Kurt Selchow

Kurt Selchow (born 28 May 1886 in Oppeln, Upper Silesia, Germany) was a Minister () and Director of the Z Branch, the Signal Intelligence Agency of the German Foreign Office () before and during World War II. 

His father was Hugo Selchow. His wife was Erna Selchow and he had one daughter called Gitta. He was educated in Oppeln until 1906 when he became a soldier. He was initially assigned to the Infantry, then in 1912 he was transferred to Signal Corps (""Nachrichten Telegrafen Bataillon"") in Frankfurt (Oder). 

He served with the German Army of World War I as a signal officer with the troop. Selchow stated that even in the midst of World War I, he pointed out to the Chief Signal Office that much of the work being done in the German Army Signal Corps belonged properly to the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs because of its diplomatic nature. The Chief Signal Officer did not agree with this statement and during World War I much of the work done by the Army was diplomatic in nature. Directly after the war, Selchow entered the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where he organized the cipher bureau. He brought with him several soldiers who had been with him during World War I. These were Schauffler, Paschke, Zastrow, Brandes, Hoffman and Kunze. He is listed as a Principal Foreign Office Specialist (""Vortragender Legationsrat"") on November 1, 1935, with the rank of Minister in 1945. In mid-April 1947, Selchow moved to Wedel in Hamburgh. After the war Selchow maintained contact with some of his colleagues. Little is known about his abilities, but statements from personnel in other cipher bureaus imply that he was jealous and secretive. His Pers Z S staff characterized him as a ""competent administrator"" who knew little about cryptography and cryptanalysis. Selchow was somewhat of a Europhile and detested the Nazi Party. With the advent of Adolf Hitler in 1933 and Hermann Göring's Forschungsamt cipher bureau encroached upon the field of the Pers Z S, which was the interception and processing of diplomatic ciphers. Selchow at the time fervently wished to resign by was persuaded to stay by von Bülow, who until 1938 was Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, when he died. When Joachim von Ribbentrop, the new Foreign Minister, he lost a lot of supervisory power, and was restricted in duties. He was forced to join the Nazi Party in 1941. During World War II, he had no exact knowledge of the messages passed between different parties, and took no part in any matters pertaining to diplomacy. He remained head of the cipher bureau until May 1945.",Kurt Selchow,167
"Garlic oil

Garlic oil is the volatile oil (essential oil) derived from garlic. It is usually prepared using steam distillation, and can also be produced via distillation using ether. It is used in cooking and as a seasoning, a nutritional supplement, and also as an insecticide.

Garlic oil is typically prepared using steam distillation, whereby crushed garlic is steamed with the resultant condensation containing the oil. Garlic oil contains volatile sulfur compounds such as diallyl disulfide, which is the ""most abundant constituent"" of essential garlic oil. Steam-distilled garlic oil typically has a pungent odor and a yellow-brownish coloration. Its odor has been attributed to the presence of diallyl disulfide. To produce around 1 g of pure steam-distilled garlic oil, around 500 g garlic is required. Steam-distilled garlic oil has around 900 times the strength of fresh garlic, and around 200 times the strength of dehydrated garlic.

Ether can also be used to extract garlic oil. A type of garlic oil involves soaking diced or crushed garlic in vegetable oil, but this is not pure garlic oil; rather it is a garlic-infused oil.

Garlic oil is used as a nutritional supplement, and is sometimes purveyed in the form of capsules, which may be diluted with other ingredients. Some commercial preparations are produced with various levels of dilution, such as a preparation that contains 10% garlic oil. Some herbal folklore sources have stated that garlic oil possesses antifungal and antibiotic properties. It is also purveyed in health food stores as a digestive aid.

It can also be used as an insecticide, whereby it is diluted with water and sprayed on plants.

Stabilized garlic flavor blend is a proprietary mixture of dehydrated garlic powder infused with garlic oil, which increases the flavor of the garlic powder.

Garlic-flavored oil is produced and used for cooking and seasoning purposes, and is sometimes used as an ingredient in seasoning mixtures. This differs from essential garlic oil, and typically involves the use of chopped, macerated or crushed garlic placed in various vegetable oils to flavor the oil.",Garlic oil,168
"John Primrose (brewer)

John Primrose (c. 1803 – 28 November 1876) was a Scottish distiller and brewer who had a substantial career in South Australia. He was the founder of the Union Brewery in Rundle Street, the colony's first successful brewery.

Primrose was the son of a distiller in Cambridge, near Alloa. He was educated at the High School in Edinburgh, and on leaving school he joined his father's establishment, where he remained for some time, gaining sound practical and scientific knowledge of the arts of brewing and distilling. He gained further experience managing a distillery for the Messrs. Shea, of Belfast, then that of Beamish, in Cork. He remained with them for several years, only leaving them to establish a brewery on his own account on the Isle of Man.
He was then attracted to Australia, with the prospect of managing a large established distillery in Sydney.

Primrose arrived in South Australia aboard ""Ariadne"" in August 1839 and somehow never made it to Sydney. 
Shortly after his arrival he set up a distillery in partnership with John Richmond. 
After carrying it on for about two years he ceased operation on account of the Government demanding payment of duty upon all spirit manufactured in the colony, at the same rate as if it had been imported. 
Primrose then turned his attention to brewing, and in 1841 founded the Union Brewery in Rundle Street, which he carried on until a few years before his death, transferring the management to his nephew William Ross Sawers (c. 1839–1911) and Arthur Rait Malcom (c. 1847–1890), his son-in-law.

His remains were interred in the West Terrace Cemetery.

"Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification System

The Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantifications System (POP-Q), is a system of assessing the degree of prolapse of pelvic organs to help standardize diagnosing, comparing, documenting, and sharing of clinical findings. This assessment is used the most frequently. In the UK urologists can specialize in in female urology, The Baden–Walker Halfway Scoring System is used as the second most used system. More research publications related to pelvic organ prolapse use the POP-Q as the measure of pelvic organ prolapse.

Pelvic organ prolapse, when assessed using the POP-Q, identifies the prevalence of pelvic organ prolapse to be up to 50% while diagnosis by symptoms has a prevalence of 3–6 %. Some advocate that the system of assessment be modified.

The POP-Q was developed in 1996 and it quantifies the descent of pelvic organs into the vagina. The POP-Q provides reliable description of the support of the anterior, posterior and apical vaginal wall. It uses objective and precise distance measurements to the reference point, the hymen. Cystocele and prolapse of the vagina from other causes is staged using POP-Q criteria can range from good support (no descent into the vagina) reported as a POP-Q stage 0 or I to a POP-Q score of IV; which includes prolapse beyond the hymen. It also used to quantifies the movement of other structures into the vaginal lumen and their descent.

The POP-Q assessment tool measures nine points in the vagina. The hymen is the reference point to which the other points are compared. The prolapsed organs are measured in centimeters to the hymen. The measurements are taken when the Valsalva maneuver is performed by the woman while in the dorsal lithotomy position. The anatomical landmarks used are anterior vaginal wall, cervix, hymen, perineal body, total vaginal length, posterior vaginal wall and posterior fornix. A three by three centimeter grid is used to record the proximal and distal numbers. The information on the grid is translated to the appropriate stage of prolapse.

The evaluation of pelvic organ prolapse includes other diagnostic tests in addition to the POP-Q. These can be:
In the US, greater than 200,000 surgeries are performed each year for pelvic organ prolapse. Examples of pelvic organ prolapse are cystocele, rectocele, urethrocele, enterocele and sigmoidocele. Cystocele is the most common. This system of assessing pelvic organ prolapse is currently used widely in China and the US.

Other assessment tools are used to determine the impact of pelvic floor prolapse. These are Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire (PFIQ),The Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory (PFDI) and the shorter forms PFIQ-7 and PFDI-20.",Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification System,174

"Lying in a Hammock at William Duffy's Farm in Pine Island, Minnesota

""Lying in a Hammock at William Duffy's Farm in Pine Island, Minnesota"" is a poem by American poet James Wright. It is one of his best known poems, partially because of the tonal contrast between the content of the poem and its final line.

The poem was first published in ""The Paris Review"". It was later featured in a short story by Ann Beattie also published in ""The Paris Review"". The poem was included in Wright's collection ""This Branch Will Not Break"".

The poem is a description of a pastoral scene from the perspective of a person in a hammock. 

Much of the critical attention focused on the poem has concerned the last line. Dan Piepenbring, writing for ""The Paris Review"", summarized the criticism in a 2010 article:

Since [the poem's publication], that last line has inspired reams of analysis and debate—is it a lament? Is it a joke, a kind of boast? Did Wright intend to undercut or to bolster his pastoral scene with it? Could it be a winking response to Rilke, whose “Archaic Torso of Apollo” concludes with the imperative “You must change your life”?

Thom Gunn, in 1964, dismissed the line as ""...certainly meaningless. The more one searches for an explicit meaning in it, the vaguer it becomes. Other general statements of different import could well be substituted for it and the poem would neither gain nor lose strength."" Robert Bly, a friend of Wright, wrote in defense of the line a year later, and criticized Gunn for being unable to relate to the emotion expressed by the line.

David Mitchell has said that the line is a happy one, writing: ""...I hear him exhale it with a wry laugh"".

The line is discussed in Ann Beattie's short story ""Yancey"".

Wright acknowledged that he was influenced by Chinese poetry in writing ""Lying in a Hammock..."" in an interview with Dave Smith. This influence has been discussed by academics including Sven Birkerts.

The poem has been widely anthologized. It is one of David Mitchell's favorite pieces of writing.",Lying in a Hammock at William Duffy s Farm in Pine Island  Minnesota,177

After a bankruptcy in 2009 she returned two years later with a collection furniture, fabrics, lighting, jewelery and pictorial work. She designed the clothes for the opera La Traviata. The last ten years of her life she lived and worked in a converted watermill in Asbeek.

The designer overcame in 1989 a form of cancer. She died unexpectedly on 22 June 2012 pneumonia by pneumococcus. She is survived by two daughters. The months before her death she had a lot of projects in the pipeline. For example, she designed the uniforms for the cabin crew of Thomas Cook Airlines Belgium and there was the collection for the clothing chain JBC. For the fall of 2012 she was working on the costume design of the musical Peter Pan. Preparations for the sale of its archive at the end of June 2012 were in full swing.

The funeral ceremony of the designer took place on 28 June in an intimate circle at her domain in Asbeek.",Kaat Tilley,184
"Fritz Lustig

Fritz Lustig (1919–2017) was a German-Jewish emigrant to England during the Nazi era.

Lustig was born on 31 March 1919. he arrived in the United Kingdom in April 1939 (his parents later left Germany for Portugal; his brother, Ted, to the United States, for whom he fought during the war).

He was briefly interned as an ""enemy alien"", at Peveril Camp, on the Isle of Man, in 1940, following the outbreak of World War II. He then enlisted in the British Army's Pioneer Corps, playing cello in its orchestra, but was transferred to the Combined Services Detailed Interrogation Centre in 1943, where he eavesdropped on captured Axis officers at Latimer House and Wilton Park in Buckinghamshire, known then as ""No 1 Distribution Centre"" and ""No 2 Distribution Centre"" respectively.

After rising to Regimental Sergeant Major, he was demobbed in June 1946. He subsequently worked in accountancy and credit control. He obtained British nationality in May 1947.

While working for CSDIC he met Susan Cohn, also a refugee from Germany. They were married in 1945. She died in 2013. One of their two sons is the broadcaster Robin Lustig. The other is Stephen, a music publisher.

Lustig died on 18 December 2017. Several obituaries were published, including those in ""The Times"", and ""The Guardian"", and one on the BBC Radio 4 programme ""Last Word"".",Fritz Lustig,185

"Somewhere Over the Rainbow (Harold Mabern album)

Somewhere Over the Rainbow is an album by pianist Harold Mabern. It was recorded in 2005 and released by Venus Records.

The album was recorded on November 11, 2005, at The Studio in New York. It was produced by Tetsuo Hara and Todd Barkan. The personnel are Harold Mabern (piano), Dwayne Burno (bass), and Willie Jones III (drums).

All of the compositions are by Harold Arlen. Mabern commented that, ""I've always studied him because his music is very bluesy. And you don't really have to do anything to his music but just go ahead and play it."" Jones uses brushes on most of the tracks. ""A Sleeping Bee"" gets a ""gospel-inflected soul-jazz treatment"". ""This Time the Dream's on Me"" has ""a hip Latin vamp to introduce a soul-jazz-infused arrangement"". Mabern's arrangement of ""Savannah"" begins as a calypso and then shifts into hard bop. ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" was released by Venus Records.",Somewhere Over the Rainbow  Harold Mabern album ,193
"Starry Internet

Starry Internet is a fixed wireless broadband Internet service provider (ISP or WISP) operated by Starry, Inc., using millimeter-band LMDS connections, sometimes categorized as 5G fixed wireless, to connect its base stations to customer buildings.

Starry, Inc. was publicly announced in January 2016 by Chaitanya ""Chet"" Kanojia, who had previously founded Aereo. , it is providing commercial service to a limited number of apartment buildings in the Boston area for $50/month per apartment, promising 200Mbit/s upload and download speeds. , Starry was based in Boston, had about 100 employees, and had raised $63 million of funding. Kanojia claims that Starry's capital cost will be only $25 per home, as compared to $2,500 for cable.

Starry's system operates on the 38.2 GHz and 38.6 GHz bands, connecting its base stations (""Starry Beam"") to receivers on individual buildings (""Starry Points""). Each base station covers a radius of 1.5 km. Signal propagation is near line-of-sight, not penetrating buildings and windows, and is degraded by foliage or rain, so Starry directs its signal using Multi-user MIMO phased array antennas, and can take advantage of reflections. 

The base station redistributes its signal within a building using Starry's own Wi-Fi router (""Starry Station"").

Analysts are mixed about Starry's prospects. Some point to the failure of Clearwire (which operated WiMax on the 2.5 GHz band), or to technical challenges: ""The physics are tough to overcome, and technology has been slow to improve here."" Others note that if the expected low fixed costs per user are achieved, ""they could profitably offer competitive broadband speeds for a fraction of the current price of wired broadband"".

In January 2018, Starry announced they would be rolling out a beta version of their internet service in Los Angeles and Washington, DC later in the month.

"Cyrtoctenus

Cyrtoctenus is a genus of prehistoric eurypterid classified within the family Hibbertopteridae. The genus contains six species, ranging in temporal range from the Devonian to the Carboniferous.

""Cyrtoctenus wittebergensis"" is one of the few eurypterids known from the southern hemisphere, where eurypterid finds are rare and usually fragmentary.

""Cyrtoctenus"" was a gigantic Hibbertopterid eurypterid, with ""C. wittebergensis"" reaching lengths of around 1.5 meters. The anterior movable spines of the distal podomeres on the second, third and fourth prosomal appendages were modified to form ""fingers"" associated with fixed combs developed as modifications of the posterior spine.

""Cyrtoctenus"" had further adaptations towards sweep-feeding than other hibbertopterids, with its blades modified into comb-like rachis that could entrap smaller prey or other organic food particles. With its coxae being large, it is likely that ""Cyrtoctenus"" would also feed on relatively large invertebrates when able to.

It is believed that some of the genera within the Hibbertopteridae represent synonyms of each other. Four of the genera in the family, ""Campylocephalus"", ""Hastimima, Dunsopterus"" and ""Vernonopterus"" are clearly hibbertopterids but known from very incomplete specimens. Further discoveries may point to that some of them are synonymous with either ""Hibbertopterus"" or ""Cyrtoctenus"".

Furthermore, ""Cyrtoctenus"" and ""Hibbertopterus"" might represent different ontogenetic stages of each other, where rachis would have developed in the later moult stages. This would also explain why smaller ""Hibbertopterus"" specimens are more complete than the fragmentary remains known of ""Cyrtoctenus"", as the majority of ""Hibbertopterus"" specimens would represent exuviae whilst ""Cyrtoctenus"" specimens represent actual mortalities susceptible to scavengers.

The species currently seen as valid species of the genus are:",Cyrtoctenus,195

"Harry Driggs

Harry Driggs (November 3, 1935 — July 14, 2007) was an American artist, graphic designer, political activist and underground cartoonist who designed the leafy graphic logo for California's Green Party. In June 1967 the San Francisco Diggers published a small edition of his pioneering 28-page underground comic ""The Life and Loves of Cleopatra"", an obscene travesty inspired by the Elizabeth Taylor film ""Cleopatra"", which they gave away free in the Diggers' Free Store at the corner of Cole and Carl in Haight-Ashbury. This small first edition was issued anonymously without the knowledge or permission of Driggs, who left for New York City where he joined the staff of the radical newspaper ""The National Guardian"". When he returned to San Francisco in 1969 he authorized Don Donahue to bring out a new, redrawn edition under the pseudonym ""R. Diggs"". A third edition was self-published by Driggs in 1977 and Rip Off Press put out a reformatted fourth edition with new comix by Driggs in 1991.

He was a longtime resident of San Francisco, where he worked in advertising as a graphic designer and art director. He served as art director for the underground newspaper ""Good Times"" where he recruited Trina Robbins to draw for the paper. In the 1980s he joined the newly-formed Green Party, for which he designed posters, newsletters, and other materials, and did design work for local non-profits. He also contributed to ""Rip Off Comix"" and Last Gasp's"" Anarchy Comics"". Two volumes of his political cartoons were published by Rip[ Off Press in 1977 and 1979, under the title ""Great Diggs"".",Harry Driggs,198
